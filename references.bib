Zeus is a hybrid algorithm that employs evolutionary computation for feature extraction, and a support vector machine for the final backend classification. Support vector machines have a reputation for classifying in high-dimensional spaces without overfitting, so the utility of reducing dimensionality with an intermediate feature selection step has been questioned. We address this question by testing Zeus on a lightning classification task using data acquired from the Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) satellite.},

abstract = {Data classification is an important topic in the field of data mining due to its wide applications. A number of related methods have been proposed based on the well-known learning models such as decision tree or neural network. Although data classification was widely discussed, relatively few studies explored the topic of temporal data classification. Most of the existing researches focused on improving the accuracy of classification by using statistical models, neural network, or distance-based methods. However, they cannot interpret the results of classification to users. In many research cases, such as gene expression of microarray, users prefer the classification information above a classifier only with a high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-based data mining method, namely classify-by-sequence (CBS), for classifying large temporal datasets. The main methodology behind the CBS is integrating sequential pattern mining with probabilistic induction. The CBS has the merit of simplicity in implementation and its pattern-based architecture can supply clear classification information to users. Through experimental evaluation, the CBS was shown to deliver classification results with high accuracy under two real time series datasets. In addition, we designed a simulator to evaluate the performance of CBS under datasets with different characteristics. The experimental results show that CBS can discover the hidden patterns and classify data effectively by utilizing the mined sequential patterns. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study was based on a retrospective chart review of 85 children with CP followed from {\textless} or =2 to {\textgreater} or =12 years of age. The GMFCS was applied to clinical notes by two blinded raters four times throughout the study. Interrater reliability was high (G=0.93). Test-retest reliability was high (G=0.79). The positive predictive value of the GMFCS at 1 to 2 years of age to predict walking by age 12 years was 0.74. The negative predictive value was 0.90. The GMFCS can validly predict motor function for children with CP. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for clinical practice and future research.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Exacerbations are important events in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Preventing exacerbations is a key treatment goal. Observational data suggest that after a first exacerbation, patients may be at increased risk of a second exacerbation, but this has not been specifically studied. We hypothesized that exacerbations may cluster together in time, a finding that would have important implications for targeting preventative interventions and the analysis of clinical trial data. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether exacerbations are random events, or cluster in time. METHODS: A total of 297 patients in the London chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort recorded daily symptoms and were assessed for a total of 904 patient-years. The observed timing of second exacerbations after an initial exacerbation was compared with that expected should exacerbations occur randomly. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The observed timing distribution of second exacerbations differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) from the expected exponential function (shape parameter of the fitted Weibull function, 0.966 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.948-0.985]), suggesting that more second exacerbations occurred sooner than later and that exacerbations cluster together in time. Twenty-seven percent of first exacerbations were followed by a second recurrent event within 8 weeks. Approximately one third of exacerbations were recurrent exacerbations. Although initial exacerbations were milder than isolated events, they were not less likely to receive treatment, and under-treatment of initial events is not a plausible explanation for exacerbation recurrence. Recurrent exacerbations contribute significantly to overall exacerbation frequency (rho = 0.81; P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Exacerbations are not random events but cluster together in time such that there is a high-risk period for recurrent exacerbation in the 8-week period after an initial excerbation.},

Despite of its good theoretic foundations and high classification accuracy, normal SVM is not suitable for classification of large data sets, because the training complexity of SVM is highly dependent on the size of data set. This paper presents a novel SVM classification approach for large data sets by using minimum enclosing ball clustering. After the training data are partitioned by the proposed clustering method, the centers of the clusters are used for the first time SVM classification. Then we use the clusters whose centers are support vectors or those clusters which have different classes to perform the second time SVM classification. In this stage most data are removed. Several experimental results show that the approach proposed in this paper has good classification accuracy compared with classic SVM while the training is significantly faster than several other SVM classifiers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Developing powerful risk management tools becomes more than ever crucial to survive. Therefore this paper analyzes whether microfinance institutions can benefit from credit scoring, which has been successfully adopted in retail banking. An extensive literature overview is provided, indicating a lack of quantitative evidence, in particular for markets in Eastern Europe-Central Asia and the Middle East-Northern Africa. Two logistic regression-based scoring models are developed using data from a Bosnia-Herzegovinian microlender. The models are assessed in terms of stability, readability, and discriminatory power, indicating that credit scoring is not yet able to fully replace the human-intensive microfinance credit process. However, it is recommendable to introduce credit scoring as a refinement tool in the lending process, in order to combine both statistical and human best practices. Moreover, a microlender staff can learn from credit scoring models to validate or contrast practical intuition. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Existing fine-grained visual categorization methods often suffer from three challenges: lack of training data, large number of fine-grained categories, and high intraclass vs. low inter-class variance. In this work we propose a generic iterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping that handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in the loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on manifolds for each category. These anchor points capture intra-class variances and remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high confidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing with exemplar images, labelers will mark each candidate image as either a "true positive" or a "false positive". True positives are added into our current dataset and false positives are regarded as "hard negatives" for our metric learning model. Then the model is retrained with an expanded dataset and hard negatives for the next round. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we bootstrap a fine-grained flower dataset with 620 categories from Instagram images. The proposed deep metric learning scheme is evaluated on both our dataset and the CUB-200-2001 Birds dataset. Experimental evaluations show significant performance gain using dataset bootstrapping and demonstrate state-of-the-art results achieved by the proposed deep metric learning methods.},

Association rules are intended to identify patterns of the type: “A customer purchasing item A often also purchases item B.” Motivated partly by the goal of generalizing beyond market basket data and partly by the goal of ironing out some problems in the definition of association rules, we develop the notion of dependence rules that identify statistical dependence in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. We propose measuring significance of dependence via the chi-squared test for independence from classical statistics. This leads to a measure that is upward-closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for a border between dependent and independent itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies based on the closure property and thereby devise an efficient algorithm for discovering dependence rules. We demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness by testing it on census data, text data (wherein we seek term dependence), and synthetic data.},

This rule may hold even if rules that "people who buy jackets tend to buy shoes", and "people who buy clothes tend to buy shoes " do not hold. An obvious solution to the problem is to add all ancestors of each item in a transaction to the transaction, and then run any of the algorithms for mining association rules on these "extended transactions ". However, this "Basic " algorithm is not very fast; we present two algorithms, Cumulate and EstMerge, which run 2 to 5 times faster than Basic (and more than 100 times faster on one real-life dataset). We also present a new interest-measure for rules which uses the information in the taxonomy. Given a user-specified "minimum-interest-level", this measure prunes a large number of redundant rules; 40 {\%} to 60 {\%} of all the rules were pruned on two real-life datasets.},

abstract = {The successful application of data mining in highly visible fields like e-business, marketing and retail has led to its application in other industries and sectors. Among these sectors just discovering is healthcare. The healthcare environment is still „information rich‟ but „knowledge poor‟. There is a wealth of data available within the healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools to discover hidden relationships and trends in data. This research paper intends to provide a survey of current techniques of knowledge discovery in databases using data mining techniques that are in use in today‟s medical research particularly in Heart Disease Prediction. Number of experiment has been conducted to compare the performance of predictive data mining technique on the same dataset and the outcome reveals that Decision Tree outperforms and some time Bayesian classification is having similar accuracy as of decision tree but other predictive methods like KNN, Neural Networks, Classification based on clustering are not performing well. The second conclusion is that the accuracy of the Decision Tree and Bayesian Classification further improves after applying genetic algorithm to reduce the actual data size to get the optimal subset of attribute sufficient for heart disease prediction.},

We find that long positions make up almost all of size, 60{\%} of value, and half of momentum profits. Shorting becomes less important for momentum and more important for value as firm size decreases. The value premium decreases with firm size and is weak among the largest stocks. Momentum profits, however, exhibit no reliable relation with size. These effects are robust over 86 years of US equity data and almost 40 years of data across four international equity markets and five asset classes. Variation over time and across markets of these effects is consistent with random chance. We find little evidence that size, value, and momentum returns are significantly affected by changes in trading costs or institutional and hedge fund ownership over time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Two fuzzy versions of the k-means optimal, least squared error partitioning problem are formulated for finite subsets X of a general inner product space. In both cases, the extremizing solutions are shown to be fixed points of a certain operator T on the class of fuzzy, k-partitions of X, and simple iteration of T provides an algorithm which has the descent property relative to the least squared error criterion function. In the first case, the range of T consists largely of ordinary (i.e. non-fuzzy) partitions of X and the associated iteration scheme is essentially the well known ISODATA process of Ball and Hall. However, in the second case, the range of T consists mainly of fuzzy partitions and the associated algorithm is new; when X consists of k compact well separated (CWS) clusters, Xi , this algorithm generates a limiting partition with membership functions which closely approximate the characteristic functions of the clusters Xi . However, when X is not the union of k CWS clusters, the limiting partition is truly fuzzy in the sense that the values of its component membership functions differ substantially from 0 or 1 over certain regions of X. Thus, unlike ISODATA, the “fuzzy” algorithm signals the presence or absence of CWS clusters in X. Furthermore, the fuzzy algorithm seems significantly less prone to the “cluster-splitting” tendency of ISODATA and may also be less easily diverted to uninteresting locally optimal partitions. Finally, for data sets X consisting of dense CWS clusters embedded in a diffuse background of strays, the structure of X is accurately reflected in the limiting partition generated by the fuzzy algorithm. Mathematical arguments and numerical results are offered in support of the foregoing assertions.},

How to select the significant biomarkers from hundreds of protein markers is a key step in survival analysis. In this paper a novel method is proposed to detect the prognostic biomarkers of survival in colorectal cancer patients using wavelet analysis, genetic algorithm, and Bayes classifier. One dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is normally used to reduce the dimensionality of biomedical data. In this study one dimensional continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was proposed to extract the features of colorectal cancer data. One dimensional CWT has no ability to reduce dimensionality of data, but captures the missing features of DWT, and is complementary part of DWT. Genetic algorithm was performed on extracted wavelet coefficients to select the optimized features, using Bayes classifier to build its fitness function. The corresponding protein markers were located based on the position of optimized features. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression model 2 were used to evaluate the performance of selected biomarkers. Experiments were conducted on colorectal cancer dataset and several significant biomarkers were detected. A new protein biomarker CD46 was found to significantly associate with survival time.},

abstract = {Many lazy learning algorithms are derivatives of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, which uses a distance function to generate predictions from stored instances. Several studies have shown that k-NN's performance is highly sensitive to the definition of its distance function. Many k-NN variants have been proposed to reduce this sensitivity by parameterizing the distance function with feature weights. However, these variants have not been categorized nor empirically compared. This paper reviews a class of weight-setting methods for lazy learning algorithms. We introduce a framework for distinguishing these methods and empirically compare them. We observed four trends from our experiments and conducted further studies to highlight them. Our results suggest that methods which use performance feedback to assign weight settings demonstrated three advantages over other methods: they require less pre-processing, perform better in the presence of interacting features, and generally require less training data to learn good settings. We also found that continuous weighting methods tend to outperform feature selection algorithms for tasks where some features are useful but less important than others.},

Furthermore, we propose a new classification method RCBT. RCBT classifier is constructed from the top-k covering rule groups. The rule groups generated for building RCBT are bounded in num- ber. This is in contrast to existing rule-based classification meth- ods like CBA [19] which despite generating excessive number of redundant rules, is still unable to cover some training data with the discovered rules. Experiments show that the RCBT classifier can match or outperform other state-of-the-art classifiers on several benchmark gene expression datasets. In addition, the top-k cover- ing rule groups themselves provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for diseases directly.},

abstract = {If the Roll critique is important, changes in the variance of the stock market may be only weakly related to changes in aggregate risk and subsequent stock market excess returns. However, since individual stock returns share a common sensitivity to true market return shocks, higher aggregate risk can be revealed by higher correlation between stocks. In addition, a change in stock market variance that leaves aggregate risk unchanged can have a zero or even negative effect on the stock market risk premium. We show that the average correlation between daily stock returns predicts subsequent quarterly stock market excess returns. We also show that changes in stock market risk holding average correlation constant can be interpreted as changes in the average variance of individual stocks. Such changes have a negative relation with future stock market excess returns. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We discuss different strategies in generation and traversal of the lexicographic tree such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, or a combination of the two. These techniques provide different trade-offs in terms of the I/O, memory, and computational time requirements. We use the hierarchical structure of the lexicographic tree to successively project transactions at each node of the lexicographic tree and use matrix counting on this reduced set of transactions for finding frequent item sets. We tested our algorithm on both real and synthetic data. We provide an implementation of the tree projection method which is up to one order of magnitude faster than other recent techniques in the literature. The algorithm has a well-structured data access pattern which provides data locality and reuse of data for multiple levels of the cache. We also discuss methods for parallelization of the TreeProjection algorithm.},

abstract = {A new multistage method using hierarchical clustering for unsupervised image classification is presented. In the first phase, the multistage method performs segmentation using a hierarchical clustering procedure which confines merging to spatially adjacent clusters and generates an image partition such that no union of any neighboring segments has homogeneous intensity values. In the second phase, the segments resulting from the first stage are classified into a small number of distinct states by a sequential merging operation. The region-merging procedure in the first phase makes use of spatial contextual information by characterizing the geophysical connectedness of a digital image structure with a Markov random field, while the second phase employs a context-free similarity measure in the clustering process. The segmentation procedure of region merging is implemented as a hierarchical clustering algorithm whereby a multiwindow approach using a pyramid-like structure is employed to increase computational efficiency while maintaining spatial connectivity in merging. From experiments with both simulated and remotely sensed data, the proposed method was determined to be quite effective for unsupervised analysis. In particular, the region-merging approach based on spatial contextual information was shown to provide more accurate classification of images with smooth spatial patterns.},

The concepts of “support” of an itemset and correlation of the items within an itemset are related, though not quite the same. This cri- terion stresses the importance of the actual correlation of the items with one another rather than the absolute sup- port, Previously proposed methods to provide correlated itemsets are not necessarily applicable to very large data- bases, We provide an algorithm which provides very good computational efficiency, while maintaining statistical ro- buetneas, The fact that this algorithm relies on relative measures rather than absolute measures such as support also implies that the method can be applied to find association rules in datasets in which items may appear in a sizeable percentage of the transactions (dense datasets), datasets in which the items have varying density, or even negative as- sociation rules,},

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their out- puts into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label un- segmented sequences directly, thereby solv- ing both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its ad- vantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

While spectral clustering of vector inputs is straightfor- ward, extensions to structured data or time-series data remain less ex- plored. This paper proposes a clustering method for time-series data that couples non-parametric spectral clustering with parametric hidden Markov models (HMMs). HMMs add some beneficial structural and parametric assumptions such as Markov properties and hidden state variables which are useful for clustering. This article shows that us- ing probabilistic pairwise kernel estimates between parametric models provides improved experimental results for unsupervised clustering and visualization of real and synthetic datasets. Results are compared with a fully parametric baseline method (a mixture of hidden Markov models) and a non-parametric baseline method (spectral clustering with non- parametric time-series kernels).},

abstract = {Classification is one of the most essential tasks in data mining. Un- like other methods, associative classification tries to find all the frequent patterns existing in the input categorical data satisfying a user-specified minimum support and/or other discrimination mea- sures like minimum confidence or information-gain. Those pat- terns are used later either as rules for rule-based classifier or train- ing features for support vector machine (SVM) classifier, after a feature selection procedure which usually tries to cover as many as the input instances with the most discriminative patterns in various manners. Several algorithms have also been proposed to mine the most discriminative patterns directly without costly feature selec- tion. Previous empirical results show that associative classification could provide better classification accuracy over many datasets. Recently, many studies have been conducted on uncertain data, where fields of uncertain attributes no longer have certain values. Instead probability distribution functions are adopted to represent the possible values and their corresponding probabilities. The un- certainty is usually caused by noise, measurement limits, or other possible factors. Several algorithms have been proposed to solve the classification problem on uncertain data recently, for example by extending traditional rule-based classifier and decision tree to work on uncertain data. In this paper, we propose a novel algo- rithm uHARMONY which mines discriminative patterns directly and effectively from uncertain data as classification features/rules, to help train either SVM or rule-based classifier. Since patterns are discovered directly from the input database, feature selection usu- ally taking a great amount of time could be avoided completely. Effective method for computation of expected confidence of the mined patterns used as the measurement of discrimination is also proposed. Empirical results show that using SVM classifier our algorithm uHARMONY outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertain data classification algorithms significantly with 4{\%} to 10{\%} im- provements on average in accuracy on 30 categorical datasets under varying uncertain degree and uncertain attribute number.},

@article{Zimmerman1993,
abstract = {ABSTRACT. Many introductory statistics textbooks in education, psychology, and the social sciences consider the Friedman test to be a nonparametric counterpart of repeated-measures ANOVA, just as the Kruskal-Wallis test is a counterpart of one way ANO VA. However, it is known in theoretical statistics that the Friedman test is a generalization of the sign test and possesses the modest statistical power of the sign test for normal as well as many nonnormal distributions. Although not familiar to researchers, another significance test that can be regarded as a nonparametric coun terpart of repeated-measures ANOVA is a rank-transformation procedure, in which the usual parametric statistical analysis is performed on ranks replacing the original scores. In the present computer simulation study we compared the ordinary paired samples Student t test, the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, and the sign test for correlated samples from normal, uniform, mixed-normal, exponential, Laplace, and Cauchy distributions, for which the relative efficiency of the methods is known. We also com pared repeated-measures ANOVA, repeated-measures ANOVA on ranks, and the Friedman test for k mutually correlated samples from the same distributions, where k = 2,3, and 4. Power functions revealed that the Friedman test performed like the sign test for all distributions, whereas ANOVA on ranks performed like the Wilcoxon test. These comparisons emphasize that classification of these statistical tests in intro ductory textbooks should be revised and that more attention should be paid to the rank transformation concept.},

abstract = {A method for identifying clusters of points in a multidimensional Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek etal. (1951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a"variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those...},

Rule-based classification systems using expert systems or machine learning are a particularly useful means of incorporating ancillary data, but have been difficult to implement. We developed a means for creating a rule-based classification using classification and regression tree analysis (CART), a commonly available statistical method. The CART classification does not require expert knowledge, automatically selects useful spectral and ancillary data from data supplied by the analyst, and can be used with continuous and categorical ancillary data. We demonstrated the use of the CART classification at three increasingly detailed classification levels for a portion of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Overall accuracies ranged from 96 percent at level 1, to 79 percent at level 2, and 65 percent at level 3.},

abstract = {—Differential evolution (DE) is arguably one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter optimization algorithms in current use. DE operates through similar computational steps as employed by a standard evolutionary algorithm (EA). How-ever, unlike traditional EAs, the DE-variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of randomly selected and distinct population members. Therefore, no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the at-tention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic concepts of DE and a survey of its major variants, its application to multiobjective, constrained, large scale, and uncertain optimization problems, and the theoretical studies conducted on DE so far. Also, it provides an overview of the significant engineering applications that have benefited from the powerful nature of DE.

abstract = {We examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. Mining association rules means that, given a database of sales transactions, to discover all associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of other items in the same transaction. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items that appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first, and then, identifying, within this candidate set, these itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally, this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k, where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate sets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we develop an effective algorithm for the candidate set generation. It is a hash-based algorithm and is especially effective for the generation of a candidate set for large 2-itemsets. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. The advantage of the proposed algorithm also provides us the opportunity of reducing the amount of disk I/O required. An extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm},

Examples include network traffic, web click streams, video surveillance, and sensor networks. Data stream mining has become a hot research topic. Its goal is to extract hidden knowledge/patterns from continuous data streams. Unlike traditional data mining where the dataset is static and can be repeatedly read many times, data stream mining algorithms face many challenges and have to satisfy constraints such as bounded memory, single-pass, real-time response, and concept-drift detection. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms with a focus on clustering and classification because of their ubiquitous usage. It identifies mining constraints, proposes a general model for data stream mining, and depicts the rela-tionship between traditional data mining and data stream mining. Furthermore, it analyzes the advantages as well as limitations of data stream algorithms and suggests potential areas for future research.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

abstract = {Public goods are often publicly provided but they may also be privately provided. Modelling private provision as the Nash equilibrium of a contribution game predicts that the equilibrium will be inefficient. In addition, the model also provides a number of further predictions: income redistribution will not affect the level of provision, the mean contribution per-person will be zero in a large economy and public provision leads to one-to-one crowding out. Furthermore, if all individuals contribute towards the provision of a public good their utilities are equalised even if the income distribution is unequal. It may then seem that there is no role for redistributive policy, but social welfare can be raised by creating sufficient income inequality so that only the rich provide public goods. The design of income and commodity taxes is highly influenced by this tendency for redistribution. The paper concludes by reviewing evidence on the model's basic predictions and discussing possible extensions.},

The method of qualitative modeling is divided into two parts: fuzzy modeling and linguistic approximation. It proposes to use a fuzzy clustering method (fuzzy c-means method) to identify the structure of a fuzzy model. To clarify the advantages of the proposed method, it also shows some examples of modeling, among them a model of a dynamical process and a model of a human operator's control action.},

We investigate the idea of item reordering, which can im- prove the low-level e ciency of the algorithm. Second, we present a new way of generating $\backslash$implication rules," which are normalized based on both the antecedent and the con- sequent and are truly implications (not simply a measure of co-occurrence), and we show how they produce more in- tuitive results than other methods. Finally, we show how di erent characteristics of real data, as opposed to synthetic data, can dramatically a ect the performance of the system and the form of the results.},

abstract = {We review two clustering algorithms (hard c-means and single linkage) and three indexes of crisp cluster validity (Hubert's statistics, the Davies-Bouldin index, and Dunn's index). We illustrate two deficiencies of Dunn's index which make it overly sensitive to noisy clusters and propose several generalizations of it that are not as brittle to outliers in the clusters. Our numerical examples show that the standard measure of interset distance (the minimum distance between points in a pair of sets) is the worst (least reliable) measure upon which to base cluster validation indexes when the clusters are expected to form volumetric clouds. Experimental results also suggest that intercluster separation plays a more important role in cluster validation than cluster diameter. Our simulations show that while Dunn's original index has operational flaws, the concept it embodies provides a rich paradigm for validation of partitions that have cloud-like clusters. Five of our generalized Dunn's indexes provide the best validation results for the simulations presented.},

Pattern mining can help to obtain models for structured domains, such as graphs and sequences, and has been proposed as a means to obtain more accurate and more interpretable models. Despite the large amount of publications devoted to this topic, we believe however that an overview of what has been accomplished in this area is missing. This paper presents our perspective on this evolving area. We identify the principles of pattern mining that are important when mining patterns for models and provide an overview of pattern-based classification methods. We categorize these methods along the following dimensions: (1) whether they post-process a pre-computed set of patterns or iteratively execute pattern mining algorithms; (2) whether they select patterns model-independently or whether the pattern selection is guided by a model. We summarize the results that have been obtained for each of these methods.},

Hav-ing thus mapped sequences to a lower-dimensionality space by using only the rst few Fourier coeecients, we use R -trees to index the sequences and eeciently answer similarity queries. We provide ex-perimental results which show that our method is superior to search based on se-quential scanning.

Of primary interest was whether application of abstracted syntax or analogy to remembered exemplars could serve as a basis for judgments of grammaticality of novel stimuli. The grammatical status of test items and their objective similarity to studied exemplars were manipulated independently to investigate whether rule-based or instance-based information was a more important determinant of classification performance. Group data indicate that both factors were equally important in influencing grammaticality judgments about novel letter strings. There were, however, large individual differences in the magnitude of grammatical status effects, with a subgroup of Ss using a classification strategy other than analogy to remembered exemplars. Results support A. S. Reber and R. Allen's (see PA, Vol 63:2584) hypothesis that rule-based information can be implicitly abstracted given limited experience with richly structured stimulus domains.

abstract = {This paper discusses the theory of random-walk model and then tests the model's empirical validity. The main conclusion will be that the data seem to present consistent and strong support for the model. This implies, of course, that chart reading, though perhaps an interesting pastime, is of no real value to the stock market investor. This is an extreme statement and the chart reader is certainly free to take exception. Since the empirical evidence produced by this and other studies in support of the random-walk model is now so voluminous, the counterarguments of the chart reader will be completely lacking in force if they are not equally well supported by empirical work. By contrast the stock market trader has a much more practical criterion for judging what constitutes important dependence in successive price changes. For his purposes the random walk model is valid as long, as knowledge of the past behavior of the series of price changes cannot be used to increase expected gains. More specifically, the independence assumption is an adequate description of reality as long as the actual degree of dependence in the series of price changes is not sufficient to allow the past history of the series to be used to predict the future in a way, which makes expected profits greater than they would be under a naive buy-and-hold model.},

A principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrates that indicators group along orthogonal dimensions, and hence a market can exhibit short-term memory, long-term memory and/or calendar effects, which are all distinct sources of possible inefficiency.

abstract = {In recent years a variety of models which apparently forecast changes in stock market prices have been introduced. Some of these are summarised and interpreted. Nonlinear models are particularly discussed, with a switching regime, from forecastable to non-forecastable, the switch depending on volatility levels, relative earnings/price ratios, size of company, and calendar effects. There appear to be benefits from disaggregation and for searching for new causal variables. The possible lessons for forecasters are emphasised and the relevance for the Efficient Market Hypothesis is discussed.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is generally characterized by various positive and negative symptoms that are accompanied by significant social dysfunction. Various researchers investigated the functional impairments in schizophrenia including impaired theory of mind (TOM), poor integration of affective and cognitive information, and malfunctioning of adaptive and strategic learning process. However, most of the studies were limited to simplified cognitive tests or computerized choice games that exclude real social interaction. The aim of the current study was to investigate human strategies based on the incentives and particularly the cognitive and emotional motivations of free riding. We examined the decision patterns of 41 healthy subjects (HSs) and 37 schizophrenia patients (SZ) during the public goods game (PGG), one of the games simulating human cooperation and free riding in group interactions. Strategic decision processes during the iterative binary PGG were assessed in terms of cognitive understanding, loss sensitivity, and TOM. We found that greed and loss sensitivity both motivated free-riding behavior in the HS, but that they were more vulnerable to greedy incentives than to possible loss. More significantly, the SZ clearly displayed a lower prevalence of free riding and distinct decision patterns from HS. Nonstrategic and unexpectedly low free ridings in the SZ likely arise from poor integration of cognitive and affective information. We suggest that loss sensitivity and TOM as well as cognitive understanding are involved in regulation of the free riding and cooperative behavior.},

abstract = {Time series classification is a supervised learning problem aimed at labeling temporally structured multivariate sequences of variable length. The most common approach reduces time series classification to a static problem by suitably transforming the set of multivariate input sequences into a rectangular table composed by a fixed number of columns. Then, one of the alternative efficient methods for classification is applied for predicting the class of new temporal sequences. In this paper, we propose a new classification method, based on a temporal extension of discrete support vector machines, that benefits from the notions of warping distance and softened variable margin. Furthermore, in order to transform a temporal dataset into a rectangular shape, we also develop a new method based on fixed cardinality warping distances. Computational tests performed on both benchmark and real marketing temporal datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to other techniques. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the public goods game, players can be classified into different types according to their participation in the game. It is an important issue for economists to be able to measure players' strategy changes over time which can be considered as concept drift. In this study, we present a method for measuring changes in items' cluster membership in temporal data. The method consists of three steps in the first step, the temporal data will be transformed into a discrete series of time points then each time point will be clustered separately. In the last step, the items' membership in the clusters is compared with a reference of behaviour to determine the amount of behavioural change in each time point. Different external cluster validity indices and area under the curve are used to measure these changes. Instead of different cluster label comparison, we use these indices a new way to compare between clusters and reference points. In this study, three categories of reference of behaviours are used 1- first time point, 2- previous time pint and 3- the general overall behaviour of the items. For the public goods game, our results indicate that the players are changing over time but the change is smooth and relatively constant between any two time points.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose a simple approach to combining first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models in a single representation. A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering {\$}{\{}\backslashcal C{\}}{\$} to clustering {\$}{\{}\backslashcal C{\}}'{\$} . The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings. Keywords: Clustering; Comparing partitions; Measures of agreement; Information theory; Mutual information},

abstract = {The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dy-namic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexi-bility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we intro-duce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarray experiments generating thousands of gene expression measurements, are being used to gather information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that will be useful in diagnosing disease. We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results. Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets. Availability: The SVM software is available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/{\~{}}bgrundy/svm.

To establish new categories which depends on the players' behavioural during the game new attributes based on the old ones are created which track players behaviour during the game rounds like players profit from previous games and this accuracy in estimating other players contribution in the project. Based on the new attributes and existing main attributes (contribution and belies) new categories for players are created which they are free riders, week conditional contributors, conditional contributors, strong conditional contributors and unconditional contributors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first and then, identifying, within this candidate set, those itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we propose an effective hash-based algorithm for the candidate set generation. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. Extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Although clustering has been studied for several decades, the fundamental problem of a valid evaluation has not yet been solved. The sound evaluation of clustering results in particular on real data is inherently difficult. In the litera- ture, new clustering algorithms and their results are often externally evaluated with respect to an existing class label- ing. These class-labels, however, may not be adequate for the structure of the data or the evaluated cluster model. Here, we survey the literature of different related research areas that have observed this problem. We discuss common “defects” that clustering algorithms exhibit w.r.t. this eval- uation, and show them on several real world data sets of different domains along with a discussion why the detected clusters do not indicate a bad performance of the algorithm but are valid and useful results. An useful alternative eval- uation method requires more extensive data labeling than the commonly used class labels or it needs a combination of information measures to take subgroups, supergroups, and overlapping sets of traditional classes into account. Finally, we discuss an evaluation scenario that regards the possible existence of several complementary sets of labels and hope to stimulate the discussion among different sub-communities — like ensemble-clustering, subspace-clustering, multi-label classification, hierarchical classification or hierarchical clus- tering, and multiview-clustering or alternative clustering — regarding requirements on enhanced evaluation methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose three algorithms LCM- freq, LCM, and LCMmax for mining all frequent sets, frequent closed item sets, and maximal frequent sets, respectively, from transaction databases. The main theoretical contribution is that we construct tree- shaped transversal routes composed of only frequent closed item sets, which is induced by a parent-child relationship defined on frequent closed item sets. By traversing the route in a depth-first manner, LCM finds all frequent closed item sets in polynomial time per item set, without storing previously obtained closed item sets in memory. Moreover, we introduce several algorithmic techniques using the sparse and dense structures of input data. Algorithms for enu- merating all frequent item sets and maximal frequent item sets are obtained from LCM as its variants. By computational experiments on real world and syn- thetic databases to compare their performance to the previous algorithms, we found that our algorithms are fast on large real world datasets with natural dis- tributions such as KDD-cup2000 datasets, and many other synthetic databases.},

abstract = {Numerous interestingness measures have been proposed in statistics and data mining to assess object relationships. This is especially important in recent studies of association or correlation pattern mining. However, it is still not clear whether there is any intrinsic relationship among many proposed measures, and which one is truly effective at gauging object relationships in large data sets. Recent studies have identified a critical property, null-(transaction) invariance, for measuring associations among events in large data sets, but many measures do not have this property. In this study, we re-examine a set of null-invariant interestingness measures and find that they can be expressed as the generalized mathematical mean, leading to a total ordering of them. Such a unified framework provides insights into the underlying philosophy of the measures and helps us understand and select the proper measure for different applications. Moreover, we propose a new measure called Imbalance Ratio to gauge the degree of skewness of a data set. We also discuss the efficient computation of interesting patterns of different null-invariant interestingness measures by proposing an algorithm, GAMiner, which complements previous studies. Experimental evaluation verifies the effectiveness of the unified framework and shows that GAMiner speeds up the state-of-the-art algorithm by an order of magnitude.},

Because sample selection is viewed as a hard computational problem, this selection is done after a previous vector quantization: this way obtaining also other similar machines using centroids selected from those that are learned in a supervised manner. Several forms of designing these machines are considered, in particular with respect to sample selection; as well as some different criteria to train them. Simulation results for well-known classification problems show very good performance of the corresponding designs, improving that of support vector machines and reducing substantially their number of units. This shows that our interest in selecting samples (or centroids) in an efficient manner is justified. Many new research avenues appear from these experiments and discussions, as suggested in our conclusions.},

While some classifiers have been proposed to achieve good earliness in classification, the interpretability of early classification remains largely an open problem. Without interpretable features, application domain experts such as medical doctors may be reluctant to adopt early classification. In this paper, we tackle the problem of extracting interpretable features on time series for early classification. Specifically, we advocate local shapelets as features, which are segments of time series remaining in the same space of the input data and thus are highly interpretable. We extract local shapelets distinctly manifesting a target class locally and early so that they are effective for early classification. Our experimental results on seven benchmark real data sets clearly show that the local shapelets extracted by our methods are highly interpretable and can achieve effective early classification},

abstract = {In graph mining applications, there has been an increasingly strong urge for imposing user-specified constraints on the mining results. However, unlike most traditional itemset constraints, structural constraints, such as density and diameter of a graph, are very hard to be pushed deep into the mining process. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive study on the pruning properties of both traditional and structural constraints aiming to reduce not only the pattern search space but the data search space as well. A new general framework, called gPrune, is proposed to incorporate all the constraints in such a way that they recursively reinforce each other through the entire mining process. A new concept, Pattern-inseparable Data-antimonotonicity, is proposed to handle the structural constraints unique in the context of graph, which, combined with known pruning properties, provides a comprehensive and unified classification framework for structural constraints. The exploration of these antimonotonicities in the context of graph pattern mining is a significant extension to the known classification of constraints, and deepens our understanding of the pruning properties of structural graph constraints.},

abstract = {Abstract Download Free Sample Outlier (or anomaly) detection is a very broad field which has been studied in the context of a large number of research areas like statistics, data mining, sensor networks, environmental science, distributed systems, spatio-temporal mining, etc. Initial research in outlier detection focused on time series-based outliers (in statistics). Since then, outlier detection has been studied on a large variety of data types including high-dimensional data, uncertain data, stream data, network data, time series data, spatial data, and spatio-temporal data. While there have been many tutorials and surveys for general outlier detection, we focus on outlier detection for temporal data in this book. A large number of applications generate temporal datasets. For example, in our everyday life, various kinds of records like credit, personnel, financial, judicial, medical, etc., are all temporal. This stresses the need for an organized and detailed study of outliers with respect to such tempo...},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t This paper presents a systematic analysis of twenty four performance measures used in the complete spectrum of Machine Learning classification tasks, i.e., binary, multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical. For each classification task, the study relates a set of changes in a confusion matrix to specific characteristics of data. Then the analysis concen-trates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier's evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem. This formal analysis is supported by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classifiers. Text classification supplements the discussion with several case studies. 1. Motivation Machine Learning (ML) divides classification onto binary, multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical tasks. In this work we present a systematic analysis of twenty four performance measures used in these classification subfields. We focus on how well classes are identified without reference to computation cost or time. We consider a set of changes in a confusion matrix that correspond to specific characteristics of data. We then analyze the type of changes that do not change a measure's value and therefore preserve a classifier's evaluation. This is what we call measure invariance. As a result, we build the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem. We supplement the formal analysis by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classifiers; examples are taken from text classification. Note, that we focus on recent ML developments; more details on ML measures can be found, for example, in Sokolova, Japkowicz, and Szpakowicz (2006) which looks into relations between the measures and assessment of medical trials. To the best of our knowledge, our current study is the first reviews of ML measures which comprehensively evaluates the invariant properties of measures. Preliminary results on binary classification appear in (Sokolova {\&} Lapalme, 2007). This study expands the results two-fold, with discussion of new invariant properties, in some cases, adding monotonicity properties, and consideration of multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical measures. Empirical evaluation remains the most used approach for the algorithm assessment, although ML algorithms can be eval-uated through empirical assessment or theory or both, e.g., derived generalized bounds and empirical results (Marchand {\&} Shawe-Taylor, 2002). Evaluation techniques based on multiple experiments are considered in Dietterich (1998), one of the most cited work on empirical evaluation of ML algorithms. An extensive critique of ML evaluation practice can be found in Salzberg (1999). The author analyzes the currently used methods and their statistical validity. The paper distinguishes two goals of evaluation: a comparison of algorithms, and the feasibility of algorithms on a specific domain. Demsar (2006) sur-veys how classifiers are compared over multiple data sets. Empirical comparison is most often done by applying algorithms on various data sets and then evaluating the performance of the classifiers that the algorithms have produced; accuracy 0306-4573/{\$} -see front matter {\'{O}}},

This paper evaluates eight different concept drift detectors (ddm, eddm, pht, stepd, dof, adwin, Paired Learners, and ecdd) and performs tests using artificial datasets affected by abrupt and gradual concept drifts, with several rates of drift, with and without noise and irrelevant attributes, and also using real-world datasets. In addition, a 2k factorial design was used to indicate the parameters that most influence performance which is a novelty in the area. Also, a variation of the Friedman non-parametric statistical test was used to identify the best methods. Experiments compared accuracy, evaluation time, as well as false alarm and miss detection rates. Additionally, we used the Mahalanobis distance to measure how similar the methods are when compared to the best possible detection output. This work can, to some extent, also be seen as a research survey of existing drift detection methods.?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

In addition, it reduces the dimensionality of the feature space, which not only decreases the cost and time in the operation but also enhances the generalizability of the classi?er.

For example, metrics such as support, confidence, lift, correlation, and collective strength are often used to determine the interestingness of association patterns. However, many such measures provide conflicting information about the interestingness of a pattern, and the best metric to use for a given application domain is rarely known. In this paper, we present an overview of various measures proposed in the statistics, machine learning and data mining literature. We describe several key properties one should examine in order to select the right measure for a given application domain. A comparative study of these properties is made using twenty one of the existing measures. We show that each measure has different properties which make them useful for some application domains, but not for others. We also present two scenarios in which most of the existing measures agree with each other, namely, support-based pruning and table standardization. Finally, we present an algorithm to select a small set of tables such that an expert can select a desirable measure by looking at just this small set of tables.},

There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Unlike other species, humans cooperate in large, distantly related groups, a fact that has long presented a puzzle to biologists. The pathway by which adaptations for large-scale cooperation among nonkin evolved in humans remains a subject of vigorous debate. Results from theoretical analyses and agent-based simulations suggest that evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but can instead generate a polymorphic population that consists of individuals who vary in their degree of cooperativeness. These results resonate with the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of individual differences in understanding and modeling behavior and dynamics in experimental games and decision problems. Here, we report the results of laboratory experiments that complement both theory and simulation results. We find that our subjects fall into three types, an individual's type is stable, and a group's cooperative outcomes can be remarkably well predicted if one knows its type composition. Reciprocal types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63{\%}) of players; cooperators and free-riders are also present in our subject population. Despite substantial behavioral differences, earnings among types are statistically identical. Our results support the view that our human subject population is in a stable, polymorphic equilibrium of types.},

The quantitative evaluation of functional neuroimaging experiments: the NPAIRS data analysis framework. NeuroImage 15, 747-771]. We compare SVM to canonical variates analysis (CVA) by examining the relative sensitivity of each method to ten combinations of preprocessing choices consisting of spatial smoothing, temporal detrending, and motion correction. Important to the discussion are the issues of classification performance, model interpretation, and validation in the context of fMRI. As the SVM has many unique properties, we examine the interpretation of support vector models with respect to neuroimaging data. We propose four methods for extracting activation maps from SVM models, and we examine one of these in detail. For both CVA and SVM, we have classified individual time samples of whole brain data, with TRs of roughly 4 s, thirty slices, and nearly 30,000 brain voxels, with no averaging of scans or prior feature selection. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes an answer to these questions based on a time-varying probability of a consumption disaster. In the model, aggregate consumption follows a normal distribution with low volatility most of the time, but with some probability of a consumption realization far out in the left tail. The possibility of this poor outcome substantially increases the equity premium, while time-variation in the probability of this outcome drives high stock market volatility and excess return predictability.},

@article{Hu2016,
abstract = {Much of the vast literature on time series classification makes several assumptions about data and the algorithm's eventual deployment that are almost certainly unwarranted. For example, many research efforts assume that the beginning and ending points of the pattern of interest can be correctly identified, during both the training phase and later deployment. Another example is the common assumption that queries will be made at a constant rate that is known ahead of time, thus computational resources can be exactly budgeted. In this work, we argue that these assumptions are unjustified, and this has in many cases led to unwarranted optimism about the performance of the proposed algorithms. As we shall show, the task of correctly extracting individual gait cycles, heartbeats, gestures, behaviors, etc., is generally much more difficult than the task of actually classifying those patterns. Likewise, gesture classification systems deployed on a device such as Google Glass may issue queries at frequencies that range over an order of magnitude, making it difficult to plan computational resources. We propose to mitigate these problems by introducing an alignment-free time series classification framework. The framework requires only very weakly annotated data, such as “in this ten minutes of data, we see mostly normal heartbeats{\ldots},” and by generalizing the classic machine learning idea of data editing to streaming/continuous data, allows us to build robust, fast and accurate anytime classifiers. We demonstrate on several diverse real-world problems that beyond removing unwarranted assumptions and requiring essentially no human intervention, our framework is both extremely fast and significantly more accurate than current state-of-the-art approaches. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).},

The model is supplemented by a money management strategy that use the historical success of predictions made by the model to determine the amount of capital to invest on future predictions. Based on a number of portfolio simulations with trade signals generated by the model, we conclude that the prediction model successfully outperforms the Oslo Benchmark Index (OSEBX).},

abstract = {Extensive research for frequent-pattern mining in the past decade has brought forth a number of pattern mining algorithms that are both effective and efficient. However, the existing frequent-pattern mining algorithms encounter challenges at mining rather large patterns, called colossal frequent patterns, in the presence of an explosive number of frequent patterns. Colossal patterns are critical to many applications, especially in domains like bioinformatics. In this study, we investigate a novel mining approach called pattern-fusion to efficiently find a good approximation to the colossal patterns. With Pattern-Fusion, a colossal pattern is discovered by fusing its small core patterns in one step, whereas the incremental pattern-growth mining strategies, such as those adopted in Apriori and FP-growth, have to examine a large number of mid-sized ones. This property distinguishes pattern-fusion from all the existing frequent pattern mining approaches and draws a new mining methodology. Our empirical studies show that, in cases where current mining algorithms cannot proceed, pattern-fusion is able to mine a result set which is a close enough approximation to the complete set of the colossal patterns, under a quality evaluation model proposed in this paper.},

@article{Zaki1997a,
abstract = {Discovery of association rules is an important data mining task. Several parallel and sequential algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. Almost all of these algorithms make repeated passes over the database to determine the set of frequent itemsets (a subset of database items), thus incurring high I/O overhead. In the parallel case, most algorithms perform a sum-reduction at the end of each pass to construct the global counts, also incurring high synchronization cost. In this paper we describe new parallel association mining algorithms. The algorithms use novel itemset clustering techniques to approximate the set of potentially maximal frequent itemsets. Once this set has been identified, the algorithms make use of efficient traversal techniques to generate the frequent itemsets contained in each cluster. We propose two clustering schemes based on equivalence classes and maximal hypergraph cliques, and study two lattice traversal techniques based on bottom-up and hybrid search. We use a vertical database layout to cluster related transactions together. The database is also selectively replicated so that the portion of the database needed for the computation of associations is local to each processor. After the initial set-up phase, the algorithms do not need any further communication or synchronization. The algorithms minimize I/O overheads by scanning the local database portion only twice. Once in the set-up phase, and once when processing the itemset clusters, Unlike previous parallel approaches, the algorithms use simple intersection operations to compute frequent itemsets and do not have to maintain or search complex hash structures. Our experimental testbed is a 32-processor DEC Alpha cluster inter-connected by the Memory Channel network. We present results on the performance of our algorithms on various databases, and compare it against a well known parallel algorithm. The best new algorithm outperforms it by an order of magnitude.},

In addition, the paper examines whether the switch from narrow price limits (NPL) to wider price limits (WPL) structurally alters volatility and the day of the week anomaly. Using the extended EGARCH and PARCH asymmetric volatility models, I found that the switch from NPL to WPL structurally altered both asymmetric volatility and the day of the week anomaly in the EGX, SET and KRX. I argue that the price discovery mechanism is disrupted due to the switch as closing prices do not fully reflect all information arrived in the market when prices hit the limits and that is reflected on volatility and market efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

However, using HMM for predicting future events is not straightforward. Here we use only one HMM that is trained on the past dataset of the chosen airlines. The trained HMM is used to search for the variable of interest behavioural data pattern from the past dataset. By interpolating the neighbouring values of these datasets forecasts are prepared. The results obtained using HMM are encouraging and HMM offers a new paradigm for stock market forecasting, an area that has been of much research interest lately.},

abstract = {The problem of time series classification has attracted great interest in the last decade. However current research assumes the existence of large amounts of labeled training data. In reality, such data may be very difficult or expensive to obtain. For example, it may require the time and expertise of cardiologists, space launch technicians, or other domain specialists. As in many other domains, there are often copious amounts of unlabeled data available. For example, the PhysioBank archive contains gigabytes of ECG data. In this work we propose a semi- supervised technique for building time series classifiers. While such algorithms are well known in text domains, we will show that special considerations must be made to make them both efficient and effective for the time series domain. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse data sources including electrocardiograms, handwritten documents, manufacturing, and video datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach requires only a handful of labeled examples to construct accurate classifiers},

Three factors mainly affect these classifiers' performance, including the number of nearest neighbors, distance metric and decision rule. The experimental results demonstrated that a better classifier can be easily chosen for a given dataset through comparison the accuracy rate and the cost time through comparing different situations of four classification algorithms. Furthermore, several previous related works about improving classifier's performance have also been summarized which can provide a basic overview for both specialists and non-specialists, as well as how to select an algorithm and parameters as appropriate as possible.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The microarray technology allows for the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes for each sample. The high-dimensional gene expression data can be used to study similarities of gene expression profiles across different samples to form a gene clustering. The clusters may be indicative of genetic pathways. Parallel to gene clustering is the important application of sample classification based on all or selected gene expressions. The gene clustering and sample classification are often undertaken separately, or in a directional manner (one as an aid for the other). However, such separation of these two tasks may occlude informative structure in the data. Here we present an algorithm for the simultaneous clustering of genes and subset selection of gene clusters for sample classification. We develop a new model selection criterion based on Rissanen's MDL (minimum description length) principle. For the first time, an MDL code length is given for both explanatory variables (genes) and response variables (sample class labels). The final output of the proposed algorithm is a sparse and interpretable classification rule based on cluster centroids or the closest genes to the centroids. RESULTS: Our algorithm for simultaneous gene clustering and subset selection for classification is applied to three publicly available data sets. For all three data sets, we obtain sparse and interpretable classification models based on centroids of clusters. At the same time, these models give competitive test error rates as the best reported methods. Compared with classification models based on single gene selections, our rules are stable in the sense that the number of clusters has a small variability and the centroids of the clusters are well correlated (or consistent) across different cross validation samples. We also discuss models where the centroids of clusters are replaced with the genes closest to the centroids. These models show comparable test error rates to models based on single gene selection, but are more sparse as well as more stable. Moreover, we comment on how the inclusion of a classification criterion affects the gene clustering, bringing out class informative structure in the data. AVAILABILITY: The methods presented in this paper have been implemented in the R language. The source code is available from the first author.},

abstract = {Observed in many applications, there is a potential need of extracting a small set of frequent patterns having not only high significance but also low redundancy. The significance is usually defined by the context of applications. Previous studies have been concentrating on how to compute top-k significant patterns or how to remove redundancy among patterns separately. There is limited work on finding those top-fc patterns which demonstrate high-significance and low-redundancy simultaneously. In this paper, we study the problem of extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns from a large collection of frequent patterns. We first examine the evaluation functions for measuring the combined significance of a pattern set and propose the MMS (Maximal Marginal Significance) as the problem formulation. The problem is known as NP-hard. We further present a greedy algorithm which approximates the optimal solution with performance bound O(log k) (with conditions on redundancy), where k is the number of reported patterns. The direct usage of redundancy-aware top-k patterns is illustrated through two real applications: disk block prefetch and document theme extraction. Our method can also be applied to processing redundancy-aware top-k queries in traditional database. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

This makes sequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In this paper, we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. We summarize the sequence classification in terms of methodologies and application domains.

abstract = {Current state-of-the-art association rule-based classifiers for gene expression data operate in two phases: (i) Association rule mining from training data followed by (ii) Classification of query data using the mined rules. In the worst case, these methods require an exponential search over the subset space of the training data set's samples and/or genes during at least one of these two phases. Hence, existing association rule-based techniques are prohibitively computationally expensive on large gene expression datasets. Our main result is the development of a heuristic rule-based gene expression data classifier called Boolean Structure Table Classification (BSTC). BSTC is explicitly related to association rule-based methods, but is guaranteed to be polynomial space/time. Extensive cross validation studies on several real gene expression datasets demonstrate that BSTC retains the classification accuracy of current association rule-based methods while being orders of magnitude faster than the leading classifier RCBT on large datasets. As a result, BSTC is able to finish table generation and classification on large datasets for which current association rule-based methods become computationally infeasible. BSTC also enjoys two other advantages over association rule-based classifiers: (i) BSTC is easy to use (requires no parameter tuning), and (ii) BSTC can easily handle datasets with any number of class types. Furthermore, in the process of developing BSTC we introduce a novel class of Boolean association rules which have potential applications to other data mining problems.},

abstract = {Different evaluation measures assess different characteristics of machine learning algorithms. The empirical evaluation of algorithms and classifiers is a matter of on-going debate between researchers. Although most measures in use today focus on a classifier's ability to identify classes correctly, we suggest that, in certain cases, other properties, such as failure avoidance or class discrimination may also be use- ful. We suggest the application of measures which evaluate such properties. These measures – Youden's index, likeli- hood, Discriminant power – are used in medical diagnosis. We show that these measures are interrelated, and we apply them to a case study from the field of electronic negotiations. We also list other learning problems which may benefit from the application of the proposed measures. Introduction},

The present study was undertaken in order to explore their utility as a scoring (ranking) function in the classification of protein sequences. RESULTS: We used a simple LRA-based on the maximal similarity (or minimal distance) scores of the two top ranking sequence classes. The scoring methods (Smith-Waterman, BLAST, local alignment kernel and compression based distances) were compared on datasets designed to test sequence similarities between proteins distantly related in terms of structure or evolution. It was found that LRA-based scoring can significantly outperform simple scoring methods.},

Our experiments show that the performance of this algorithm is competitive to that of processing ordinary (exact match) queries using the index, and much faster than sequential scanning. We relate our transformations to the general framework for similarity queries of Jagadish et al.},

abstract = {Temporal clustering of human motion into semantically meaningful behaviors is a challenging task. While unsupervised methods do well to some extent, the obtained clus- ters often lack a semantic interpretation. In this paper, we propose to learn what makes a sequence of human poses different from others such that it should be annotated as an ac- tion. To this end, we formulate the problem as weakly supervised temporal clustering for an unknown number of clusters. Weak supervision is attained by learning a metric from the implicit semantic distances derived from already annotated databases. Such a metric contains some low-level semantic information that can be used to effectively segment a human motion sequence into distinct actions or behaviors. The main advantage of our approach is that metrics can be successfully used across datasets, making our method a compelling alternative to unsupervised methods. Experiments on publicly available mocap datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.},

The technique has flourished, particularly in the last three years, and has been applied to a variety of problems in various disciplines. In spite of DTW's great success, there are still several persistent " myths " about it. These myths have caused confusion and led to much wasted research effort.

Together with many other disciplines, machine learning methods have been widely employed in bioinformatics. The difficulties and cost of biological analyses have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning approaches for this application area. In this chapter, we first review the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised versus supervised learning and types of classification. Then, we point out the main issues of designing machine learning experiments and their performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce some supervised learning methods.},

abstract = {The Royal London Space Planning process has evolved since 1985 to ensure a disciplined approach to diagnosis and treatment planning and to provide a record to justify treatment decisions for professional accountability. The analysis takes into consideration most aspects of a given malocclusion and aims to quantify the space required in each dental arch to attain the treatment objectives. Space planning also helps determine whether the objectives are likely to be attainable and helps in the planning of treatment mechanics and the control of anchorage. The process of analysis is divided into 2 sections. The first part consists of assessing the original malocclusion according to various component parts, any of which may have an effect on space if altered during treatment. These components are crowding and spacing, occlusal curves, arch width, anteroposterior position of labial segments, mesiodistal angulation, and incisor inclination. The second part of the analysis, which will be published in a separate article, deals with the effect of treatment procedures, such as extractions, tooth-size modifications, distal or mesial molar movements, as well as natural growth, on the space required. Space planning should be regarded only as a useful guide, as many areas of orthodontics - including growth, biological response, and patient compliance - cannot be controlled with total accuracy.},

abstract = {Similarities among subsequences are typically regarded as categorical features of sequential data. We introduce an algorithm for capturing the relationships among similar, contiguous subsequences. Two time series are considered to be similar during a time interval if every contiguous subsequence of a predefined length satisfies the given similarity criterion. Our algorithm identifies patterns based on the similarity among sequences, captures the sequence-subsequence relationships among patterns in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and determines pattern conglomerates that allow the application of additional meta-analyses and mining algorithms. For example, our pattern conglomerates can be used to analyze time information that is lost in categorical representations. We apply our algorithm to stock market data as well as several other time series data sets and show the richness of our pattern conglomerates through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. An exemplary meta-analysis determines timing patterns representing relations between time series intervals and demonstrates the merit of pattern relationships as an extension of time series pattern mining. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = { Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that may exist implicitly in spatial databases. To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, it proposes a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, the paper develops two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.},

While some learners may suffer from class imbalances and instances sparsely distributed around the feature space, we show that LCSs are flexible methods that can be adapted to detect such cases and find suitable models. Results on artificial data sets specifically designed for testing the capabilities of LCSs in imbalanced data show that LCSs are able to extract knowledge from highly imbalanced domains. When LCSs are used with real-world problems, they demonstrate to be one of the most robust methods compared with instance-based learners, decision trees, and support vector machines. Moreover, all the learners benefit from re-sampling techniques. Although there is not a re-sampling technique that performs best in all data sets and for all learners, those based in over-sampling seem to perform better on average. The paper adapts and analyzes LCSs for challenging imbalanced data sets and establishes the bases for further studying the combination of re-sampling technique and learner best suited to a specific kind of problem.},

abstract = {There has been an increase in research interest for brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as an alternate mode of communication and environmental control for the disabled, such as patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke and spinal cord injury. Disabled patients with appropriate physical care and cognitive ability to communicate with their social environment continue to live with a reasonable quality of life over extended periods of time. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which utilizes light in the near-infrared range (700 to 1000 nm) to determine cerebral oxygenation, blood flow and metabolic status of localized regions of the brain. In this paper, we describe a study conducted to test the feasibility of using multichannel NIRS in the development of a BCI. We used a continuous wave 20-channel NIRS system over the motor cortex of 5 healthy volunteers to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes during left-hand and right-hand motor imagery. We present results of signal analysis indicating that there exist distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses which could be utilized in a pattern classifier towards developing a BCI. We applied two different pattern recognition algorithms separately, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to classify the data offline. SVM classified left-hand imagery from right-hand imagery with an average accuracy of 73{\%} for all volunteers, while HMM performed better with an average accuracy of 89{\%}. Our results indicate potential application of NIRS in the development of BCIs. We also discuss here future extension of our system to develop a word speller application based on a cursor control paradigm incorporating online pattern classification of single-trial NIRS data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Classification rule mining aims to discover a small set of rules in the database that forms an accurate classifier. Association rule mining finds all the rules existing in the database that satisfy some minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. For association rule mining, the target of discovery is not pre-determined, while for classification rule mining there is one and only one predetermined target. In this paper, we propose to integrate these two mining techniques. The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARs). An efficient algorithm is also given for building a classifier based on the set of discovered CARs. Experimental results show that the classifier built this way is, in general, more accurate than that produced by the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5. In addition, this integration helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems. Introduction ...},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of distributed representation of fuzzy rules and applies it to classification problems. Distributed representation is implemented by superimposing many fuzzy rules corresponding to different fuzzy partitions of a pattern space. This means that we simulatenously employ many fuzzy rule tables corresponding to different fuzzy partitions in fuzzy inference. In order to apply distributed representation of fuzzy rules to pattern classification problems, we first propose an algorithm to generate fuzzy rules from numerical data. Next we propose a fuzzy inference method using the generated fuzzy rules. The classification power of distributed representation is compared with that of ordinary fuzzy rules which can be viewed as local representation. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Time series stored as feature vectors can be indexed by multi-dimensional index trees like R-Trees for fast retrieval. Due to the dimensionality curse problem, transformations are applied to time series to reduce the number of dimensions of the feature vec-tors. Different transformations like Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transform or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be ap-plied. While the use of DFT and K-L transform or SVD have been studied in the literature, to our knowledge, there is no in-depth study on the application of DWT. In this paper, we propose to use Haar Wavelet Transform for time series indexing. The major con-tributions are: (1) we show that Euclidean distance is preserved in the Haar transformed domain and no false dismissal will occur, (2) we show that Haar transform can outperform DFT through experiments, (3) a new similarity model is suggested to accom-modate vertical shift of time series, and (4) a two-phase method is proposed for efficient ¢ -nearest neighbor query in time series databases.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

abstract = {The problem of predicting stock returns has been an important issue for many years. Advancement in computer technology has allowed many recent studies to utilize machine learning techniques such as neural networks and decision trees to predict stock returns. In the area of machine learning, classifier ensembles (i.e. combining multiple classifiers) have proven to be a method superior to single classifiers. In order to build a better model for predicting stock returns effectively and efficiently, this study aims at investigating the prediction performance that utilizes the classifier ensembles method to analyze stock returns. In particular, the hybrid methods of majority voting and bagging are considered. Moreover, performance using two types of classifier ensembles is compared with those using single baseline classifiers (i.e. neural networks, decision trees, and logistic regression). These two types of ensembles are 'homogeneous' classifier ensembles (e.g. an ensemble of neural networks) and 'heterogeneous' classifier ensembles (e.g. an ensemble of neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression). Average prediction accuracy, Type I and II errors, and return on investment of these models are also examined. Our results indicate that multiple classifiers outperform single classifiers in terms of prediction accuracy and returns on investment. In addition, heterogeneous classifier ensembles offer slightly better performance than the homogeneous ones. However, there is no significant difference between majority voting and bagging in prediction accuracy, but the former has better stock returns prediction accuracy than the latter. Finally, the homogeneous multiple classifiers using neural networks by majority voting perform best when predicting stock returns. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Clustering time series data has a wide range of applications and has attracted researchers from a wide range of discipline. In this paper a novel algorithm for shape based time series clustering is proposed. It can reduce the size of data, improve the efficiency and not reduce the effects by using the principle of complex network. Firstly, one-nearest neighbor network is built based on the similarity of time series objects. In this step, triangle distance is used to measure the similarity. Of the neighbor network each node represents one time series object and each link denotes neighbor relationship between nodes. Secondly, the nodes with high degrees are chosen and used to cluster. In clustering process, dynamic time warping distance function and hierarchical clustering algorithm are applied. Thirdly, some experiments are executed on synthetic and real data. The results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance on efficiency and effectiveness. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Set matching measures are based on matching clusters from two clusterings. We analyze the measures in three parts: 1. cluster similarity 2. matching 3. overall measurement. Correction for chance is also investigated and we prove that normalized mutual information and variation of information are intrinsically corrected. We propose a new scheme of experiments based on synthetic data for evaluation of an external validity index. Accordingly, popular external indexes are evaluated and compared when applied to clusterings of different data size, cluster size and number of clusters. The experiments show that set matching measures are clearly better than the other tested. Based on the analytical comparisons, we introduce a new index called Pair Sets Index (PSI).},

abstract = {Extracting important statistical patterns from wind speed time series at different time scales is of interest to wind energy industry in terms of wind turbine optimal control, wind energy dispatch/scheduling, wind energy project design and assessment, and so on. In this paper, a systematic way is presented to estimate the first order (one step) Markov chain transition matrix from wind speed time series by two steps. Wind speed time series data is used first to generate basic estimators of transition matrices (i.e. first order, second order, third order, etc.) based on counting techniques. Then an evolutionary algorithm (EA), specifically double-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm (ES), is proposed to search for the first order Markov chain transition matrix which can best match these basic estimators after transforming the first order transition matrix into its higher order counterparts. The evolutionary search for the first order transition matrix is guided by a predefined cost function which measures the difference between the basic estimators and the first order transition matrix, and its high order transformations. To deal with the potential high dimensional optimization problem (i.e. large transition matrices), an enhanced offspring generation procedure is proposed to help the ES algorithm converge efficiently and find better Pareto frontiers through generations. The proposed method is illustrated with wind speed time series data collected from individual 1.5 MW wind turbines at different time scales. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and inter-connectivity of com- puter technology is creating unprecedented quantities of digital data. Data mining, the science of extracting useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as a young and interdisciplinary field in computer science. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, en- gineering and government, and it is widely believed that data mining will have profound impact on our society. The growing consensus that data mining can bring real value has led to an explosion in demand for novel data mining technologies and for students who are trained in data mining—students who have an understanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to real-life problems, and are trained for research and development of new data mining methods. Courses in data mining have started to sprawl all over the world. Based on this development of the field, the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee has set up the ACM SIGKDD Curriculum Committee to design a sample curriculum for data mining that gives recommendations for educating the next generation of students in data mining. Based on feedback from researchers, educators, and students, we are convinced that it is an important task to have a carefully designed, conceptually strong, technically rich, and balanced curriculum for this discipline. A comprehensive and balanced curriculum will ensure that the education in data mining sets a solid foundation for the healthy growth of the field, and it will promote systematic training of students in computer science, information sciences, and other related fields, and it will provide guidance for the training of the next generation of data mining researchers, developers and technology users. The Curriculum Committee is composed of university professors and researchers who have actively con- tributed to data mining research and education, researchers and practitioners from industry who have rich experiences in applying data mining technology, and administrators from government agencies. This report is the first draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Committee. We expect that this draft will be extensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forward to suggestions and recommendations from the Committee and from the general data mining research, development, and application community. The remainder of this report is structured as follows. First, we outline the principles that guided us in the selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief description of the prerequisites that we assume students of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Section 4 contains the core of this document, our curriculum proposal},

Several issues contribute to the challenge of this task. These include the large variability in the temporal scale and periodicity of human actions, as well as the exponential nature of all possible movement combinations. We formulate the temporal segmentation problem as an extension of standard clustering algorithms. In particular, this paper proposes aligned cluster analysis (ACA), a robust method to temporally segment streams of motion capture data into actions. ACA extends standard kernel k-means clustering in two ways: (1) the cluster means contain a variable number of features, and (2) a dynamic time warping (DTW) kernel is used to achieve temporal invariance. Experimental results, reported on synthetic data and the Carnegie Mellon Motion Capture database, demonstrate its effectiveness. View full abstract},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between employee satisfaction and long-run stock returns. A value-weighted portfolio of the "100 Best Companies to Work For in America" earned an annual four-factor alpha of 3.5{\%} from 1984 to 2009, and 2.1{\%} above industry benchmarks. The results are robust to controls for firm characteristics, different weighting methodologies, and the removal of outliers. The Best Companies also exhibited significantly more positive earnings surprises and announcement returns. These findings have three main implications. First, consistent with human capital-centered theories of the firm, employee satisfaction is positively correlated with shareholder returns and need not represent managerial slack. Second, the stock market does not fully value intangibles, even when independently verified by a highly public survey on large firms. Third, certain socially responsible investing (SRI) screens may improve investment returns. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Our approach makes these contributions: (1) a robust space-time saliency method for evaluating visual importance, (2) a re-timing technique to temporally resample based on frame importance, and (3) temporal filters to enhance the rendering of salient motion. Results of our space-time saliency method on a benchmark dataset show it is state-of-the-art. In addition, the benefits of our approach to HFR-to-LFR time-mapping over more direct methods are demonstrated in a user study.},

These groups can represent different classes of objects, such as male or female students, or the same group over time, e.g. freshman students in 1993 through 1998. We present the problem of mining contrast sets: conjunctions of attributes and values that differ meaningfully in their distribution across groups. We provide a search algorithm for mining contrast sets with pruning rules that drastically reduce the computational complexity. Once the contrast sets are found, we post-process the results to present a subset that are surprising to the user given what we have already shown. We explicitly control the probability of Type I error (false positives) and guarantee a maximum error rate for the entire analysis by using Bonferroni corrections.},

The main advantage of the vertical format is support for fast frequency counting via intersection operations on transaction ids (tids) and automatic pruning of irrelevant data. The main problem with these approaches is when intermediate results of vertical tid lists become too large for memory, thus affecting the algorithm scalability.In this paper we present a novel vertical data representation called Diffset, that only keeps track of differences in the tids of a candidate pattern from its generating frequent patterns. We show that diffsets drastically cut down the size of memory required to store intermediate results. We show how diffsets, when incorporated into previous vertical mining methods, increase the performance significantly.},

abstract = {We tests two important implications for Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) market efficiency from the adaptive markets hypothesis (Lo, 2004): first, market efficiency is not an all-or-none condition but is a characteristic that varies continuously over time; second, market efficiency is dependent upon market conditions. By using the automatic variance ratio test of Choi (1999), and the automatic portmanteau test of Escanciano and Lobato (2009), we confirm both implications for the US REIT market. The degree of REIT return predictability is found to be time varying. More specifically, it appears to be declining over time, which implies that the REIT market has become more efficient. Furthermore, we show that the return predictability is indeed influenced by market conditions. The level of market development appears to be the primary driver for REIT market efficiency. Other factors like inflation and the overall equity market volatility also have impacts. Finally, we demonstrate that the REIT regulatory changes in the early 1990s have greatly improved market efficiency. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {It has been widely accepted by many studies that non-linearity exists in the financial markets and that neural networks can be effectively used to uncover this relationship. Unfortunately, many of these studies fail to consider alternative forecasting techniques, the relevance of input variables, or the performance of the models when using different trading strategies. This paper introduces an information gain technique used in machine learning for data mining to evaluate the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. Neural network models for level estimation and classification are then examined for their ability to provide an effective forecast of future values. A cross-validation technique is also employed to improve the generalization ability of several models. The results show that the trading strategies guided by the classification models generate higher risk-adjusted profits than the buy-and-hold strategy, as well as those guided by the level-estimation based forecasts of the neural network and linear regression models. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The mapping is proved to be capable of approximating any real continuous function on a compact set to arbitrary accuracy.

abstract = {Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.},

abstract = {Each day, anti-virus companies receive tens of thousands samples of potentially harmful executables. Many of the malicious samples are variations of previously encountered malware, created by their authors to evade pattern-based detection. Dealing with these large amounts of data requires robust, automatic detection approaches. This paper studies malware classification based on call graph clustering. By representing malware samples as call graphs, it is possible to abstract certain variations away, enabling the detection of structural similarities between samples. The ability to cluster similar samples together will make more generic detection techniques possible, thereby targeting the commonalities of the samples within a cluster. To compare call graphs mutually, we compute pairwise graph similarity scores via graph matchings which approximately minimize the graph edit distance. Next, to facilitate the discovery of similar malware samples, we employ several clustering algorithms, including k-medoids and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise ({\{}DBSCAN{\}}). Clustering experiments are conducted on a collection of real malware samples, and the results are evaluated against manual classifications provided by human malware analysts. Experiments show that it is indeed possible to accurately detect malware families via call graph clustering. We anticipate that in the future, call graphs can be used to analyse the emergence of new malware families, and ultimately to automate implementation of generic detection schemes.},

abstract = {This work is part of a project to develop an expert system for automated classification of the sleep/waking states in human infants; i.e. active or rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), quiet or non-REM sleep (NREM), including its four stages, indeterminate sleep (IS) and wakefulness (WA). A model to identify these states, introducing an objective formalisation in terms of the state variables characterising the recorded patterns, is presented. The following digitally recorded physiological events are taken into account to classify the sleep/waking states: predominant background activity and the existence of sleep spindles in the electro-encephalogram; existence of rapid eye movements in the electro-oculogram; and chin muscle tone in the electromyogram. Methods to detect several of these parameters are described. An expert system based on artificial ganglionar lattices is used to classify the sleep/waking states, on an off-line minute-by-minute basis. Algorithms to detect patterns automatically and an expert system to recognise sleep/waking states are introduced, and several adjustments and tests using various real patients are carried out. Results show an overall performance of 96.4{\%} agreement with the expert on validation data without artefacts, and 84.9{\%} agreement on validation data with artefacts. Moreover, results show a significant improvement in the classification agreement due to the application of the expert system, and a discussion is carried out to justify the difficulties of matching the expert's criteria for the interpretation of characterising patterns.},

In many applications where the shape of the time sequence is a major consideration, the minimum distance is a more suitable similarity measurement than the simple Lp norm. To support minimum distance queries, most of the previous work has the preprocessing step for vertical shifting which normalizes each sequence by its mean. The vertical shifting, however, has the additional overhead to get the mean of a sequence and to subtract it from each element of the sequence. The proposed method can match time series of similar shape without vertical shifting and guarantees no false dismissals. In addition, the proposed method needs only one index structure to support minimum distance queries in any arbitrary Lp norm. The experiments are performed on real data (stock price movement) to verify the performance of the proposed method.},

As an emerging stock market, it is unlikely that it is fully information-efficient, but we show that the level of weak-form efficiency has increased in recent years. We use a serial correlation test, a runs test, an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the multiple variance ratio test proposed by Lo and MacKinlay (1988) for the hypothesis that the stock market index follows a random walk. Nontrading or infrequent trading is not an issue because the PSI-20 includes only the 20 most traded shares. The tests are performed using daily, weekly and monthly returns for the whole period and for five sub-periods which reflect different trends in the market. We find mixed evidence, but on the whole, our results show that the Portuguese stock market index has been approaching a random walk behaviour since 2000, with a decrease in the serial dependence of returns.},

In this paper, we conduct a systematic exploration of frequent pattern-based classification, and provide solid reasons supporting this methodology. It was well known that feature combinations (patterns) could capture more underlying semantics than single features. However, inclusion of infrequent patterns may not significantly improve the accuracy due to their limited predictive power. By building a connection between pattern frequency and discriminative measures such as information gain and Fisher score, we develop a strategy to set minimum support in frequent pattern mining for generating useful patterns. Based on this strategy, coupled with a proposed feature selection algorithm, discriminative frequent patterns can be generated for building high quality classifiers. We demonstrate that the frequent pattern-based classification framework can achieve good scalability and high accuracy in classifying large datasets. Empirical studies indicate that significant improvement in classification accuracy is achieved (up to 12{\%} in UCI datasets) using the so-selected discriminative frequent patterns.},

We evaluate the reliability of our index both theoretically and experimentally, considering three representative clustering algorithms run on synthetic and real data sets.

In this type of classification systems, the classical Fuzzy Reasoning Method (FRM) classifies a new example with the consequent of the rule with the greatest degree of association. By using this reasoning method, we lose the information provided by the other rules with different linguistic labels which also represent this value in the pattern attribute, although probably to a lesser degree. The aim of this paper is to present new FRMs which allow us to improve the system performance, maintaining its interpretability. The common aspect of the proposals is the participation, in the classification of the new pattern, of the rules that have been fired by such pattern. We formally describe the behaviour of a general reasoning method, analyze six proposals for this general model, and present a method to learn the parameters of these FRMs by means of Genetic Algorithms, adapting the inference mechanism to the set of rules.

abstract = {Advanced analysis of data streams is quickly becoming a key area of data mining research as the number of applica- tions demanding such processing increases.  Online mining when such data streams evolve over time, that is when con- cepts drift or change completely, is becoming one of the core issues.   When tackling non-stationary concepts, ensembles of  classiﬁers  have  several  advantages  over  single  classiﬁer methods:  they are easy to scale and parallelize, they can adapt to change quickly by pruning under-performing parts of the ensemble,  and they therefore usually also generate more accurate concept descriptions.  This paper proposes a new experimental data stream framework for studying con- cept drift, and two new variants of Bagging: ADWIN  Bagging and Adaptive-Size Hoeﬀding Tree (ASHT) Bagging.  Using the new experimental framework,  an evaluation study on synthetic and real-world datasets comprising up to ten mil- lion examples shows that the new ensemble methods perform very well compared to several known methods.},

First, the criterion relies on an adaptive (i.e., parameterized) time series metric to cover both behaviors and values proximities. The metrics parameters may change from one internal node to another to achieve the best bisection of the set of time series. Second, the criterion involves the automatic extraction of the most discriminating subsequences. The proposed time series classification tree is applied to a wide range of datasets: public and new, real and synthetic, univariate and multivariate data. We show, through the experiments performed in this study, that the proposed tree outperforms temporal trees using standard time series distances and performs well compared to other competitive time series classifiers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The first phase is designed to calculate all item sets in every transaction together with their frequencies (without pruning) and indexes their accumulation in a database. This procedure needs the fetch cycle of each transaction only once which reduces fetching transactions' I/O reasonably. In the second phase, the item sets and their frequencies are used in rule producing. a new algorithm has been designed, implemented, coded, verified and tested on real data.

To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent.},

abstract = {Previous studies propose that associative classification has high
classification accuracy and strong flexibility at handling unstructured
data. However, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and
sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification
is based on only a single high-confidence rule. The authors propose a
new associative classification method, CMAR, i.e., Classification based
on Multiple Association Rules. The method extends an efficient frequent
pattern mining method, FP-growth, constructs a class
distribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large databases efficiently.
Moreover, it applies a CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined
association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on
confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is
performed based on a weighted {\&}chi;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} analysis using multiple
strong association rules. Our extensive experiments on 26 databases from
the UCI machine learning database repository show that CMAR is
consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of
databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison
with CBA and C4.5. Moreover, our performance study shows that the method
is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported
associative classification methods},

In this paper we evaluate different partitional and agglomerative approaches for hierarchical clustering. Our experimental evalua-tion showed that partitional algorithms always lead to better clus-tering solutions than agglomerative algorithms, which suggests that partitional clustering algorithms are well-suited for clustering large document datasets due to not only their relatively low computa-tional requirements, but also comparable or even better cluster-ing performance. We present a new class of clustering algorithms called constrained agglomerative algorithms that combine the fea-tures of both partitional and agglomerative algorithms.

This paper presents generalized time warping (GTW), an extension of dynamic time warping (DTW) for temporally aligning multi-modal sequences from multiple subjects performing similar activities. GTW solves three major drawbacks of existing approaches based on DTW: (1) GTW provides a feature weighting layer to adapt different modalities (e.g., video and motion capture data), (2) GTW extends DTW by allowing a more flexible time warping as combination of monotonic functions, (3) unlike DTW that typically incurs in quadratic cost, GTW has linear complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that GTW can efficiently solve the multi-modal temporal alignment problem and outperforms state-of-the-art DTW methods for temporal alignment of time series within the same modality.

abstract = {The prevalence of mobile phones, the internet-of-things technology, and networks of sensors has led to an enormous and ever increasing amount of data that are now more commonly available in a streaming fashion [1]-[5]. Often, it is assumed - either implicitly or explicitly - that the process generating such a stream of data is stationary, that is, the data are drawn from a fixed, albeit unknown probability distribution. In many real-world scenarios, however, such an assumption is simply not true, and the underlying process generating the data stream is characterized by an intrinsic nonstationary (or evolving or drifting) phenomenon. The nonstationarity can be due, for example, to seasonality or periodicity effects, changes in the users' habits or preferences, hardware or software faults affecting a cyber-physical system, thermal drifts or aging effects in sensors. In such nonstationary environments, where the probabilistic properties of the data change over time, a non-adaptive model trained under the false stationarity assumption is bound to become obsolete in time, and perform sub-optimally at best, or fail catastrophically at worst.},

abstract = {Data uncertainty is common in real-world applications due to various causes, including imprecise measurement, network latency, outdated sources and sampling errors. These kinds of uncertainty have to be handled cautiously, or else the mining results could be unreliable or even wrong. In this paper, we propose a new rule-based classification and prediction algorithm called uRule for classifying uncertain data. This algorithm introduces new measures for generating, pruning and optimizing rules. These new measures are computed considering uncertain data interval and probability distribution function. Based on the new measures, the optimal splitting attribute and splitting value can be identified and used for classification and prediction. The proposed uRule algorithm can process uncertainty in both numerical and categorical data. Our experimental results show that uRule has excellent performance even when data is highly uncertain.},

abstract = {In almost every scientific field, measurements are performed over time. These observations lead to a collection of organized data called time series. The purpose of time-series data mining is to try to extract all meaningful knowledge from the shape of data. Even if humans have a natural capacity to perform these tasks, it remains a complex problem for computers. In this article we intend to provide a survey of the techniques applied for time-series data mining. The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future. We hope that this article can provide a broad and deep understanding of the time-series data mining research field.},

abstract = {In trying to distinguish data features within time series data for specific time intervals, time series segmentation technology is often required. This research divides time series data into segments of varying lengths. A time series segmentation algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed to exhibit the changeability of the time series data. In order to verify the effect of the proposed algorithm, we experiment with the Bottom-Up method, which has been reported in available literature to give good results for time series segmentation. Simulation data and genuine stock price data are also used in some of our experiments. The research result shows that time series segmentation run by the ACO algorithm not only automatically identifies the number of segments, but its segmentation cost was lower than that of the time series segmentation using the Bottom-Up method. More importantly, during the ACO algorithm process, the degree of data loss is also less compared to that of the Bottom-Up method. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this work we study two recently proposed and successfully used kernels, namely the Spectrum kernel and the Weighted Degree kernel (WD). In particular, we suggest several extensions using Suffix Trees and modifications of an SMO-like SVM training algorithm in order to accelerate the training of the SVMs and their evaluation on test sequences. Our simulations show that for the spectrum kernel and WD kernel, large scale SVM training can be accelerated by factors of 20 and 4 times, respectively, while using much less memory (e.g. no kernel caching). The evaluation on new sequences is often several thousand times faster using the new techniques (depending on the number of Support Vectors). Our method allows us to train on sets as large as one million sequences.},

abstract = {Although most time-series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function, in this work we motivate the need for a single index structure that can support multiple distance measures. Our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities. Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model, that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real world applications. However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance, and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures, a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index. Our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision/recall. The experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed-up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the LCSS and the DTW.},

abstract = {Pattern-based classification has demonstrated its power in recent studies, but because the cost of mining discriminative patterns as features in classification is very expensive, several efficient algorithms have been proposed to rectify this problem. These algorithms assume that feature values of the mined patterns are binary, i.e., a pattern either exists or not. In some problems, however, the number of times a pattern appears is more informative than whether a pattern appears or not. To resolve these deficiencies, we propose a mathematical programming method that directly mines discriminative patterns as numerical features for classification. We also propose a novel search space shrinking technique which addresses the inefficiencies in iterative pattern mining algorithms. Finally, we show that our method is an order of magnitude faster, significantly more memory efficient and more accurate than current approaches.},

Eros is based on principal component analysis, and computes the similarity between two MTS items by measuring how close the corresponding principal components are using the eigenvalues as weights. Muse constructs each level as a distance-based index structure without using the weights, up to z levels, which are combined at the query time with the weights. Ropes utilizes both the common principal components and the weights recursively in order to select a subset of features for Eros.

abstract = {In the context of many data mining tasks, high dimensional- ity was shown to be able to pose significant problems, com- monly referred to as different aspects of the curse of dimen- sionality. In this paper, we investigate in the time-series do- main one aspect of the dimensionality curse called hubness, which refers to the tendency of some instances in a data set to become hubs by being included in unexpectedly many k-nearest neighbor lists of other instances. Through empir- ical measurements on a large collection of time-series data sets we demonstrate that the hubness phenomenon is caused by high intrinsic dimensionality of time-series data, and shed light on themechanismthrough which hubs emerge, focusing on the popular and successful dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Also, the interaction between hubness and the in- formation provided by class labels is investigated, by con- sidering label matches and mismatches between neighboring time series. Following our findings we formulate a framework for cat- egorizing time-series data sets based on measurements that reflect hubness and the diversity of class labels among near- est neighbors. The framework allows one to assess whether hubness can be successfully used to improve the performance of k-NN classification. Finally, the merits of the framework are demonstrated through experimental evaluation of 1-NN and k-NN classifiers, including a proposed weighting scheme that is designed to make use of hubness information. Our experimental results show that the examined framework, in the majority of cases, is able to correctly reflect the cir- cumstances in which hubness information can effectively be employed in k-NN time-series classification},

Carefully designed contracts can yield insight into the market's expectations about probabilities, means and medians, and also uncertainty about these parameters. Moreover, conditional markets can effectively reveal the market's beliefs about regression coefficients, although we still have the usual problem of disentangling correlation from causation. We discuss a number of market design issues and highlight domains in which prediction markets are most likely to be useful.},

abstract = {Time series is an important class of temporal data objects and it can be easily obtained from scientific and financial applications. A time series is a collection of observations made chronologically. The nature of time series data includes: large in data size, high dimensionality and necessary to update continuously. Moreover time series data, which is characterized by its numerical and continuous nature, is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical field. The increasing use of time series data has initiated a great deal of research and development attempts in the field of data mining. The abundant research on time series data mining in the last decade could hamper the entry of interested researchers, due to its complexity. In this paper, a comprehensive revision on the existing time series data mining research is given. They are generally categorized into representation and indexing, similarity measure, segmentation, visualization and mining. Moreover state-of-the-art research issues are also highlighted. The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a glossary for interested researchers to have an overall picture on the current time series data mining development and identify their potential research direction to further investigation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of finding frequent itemsets in a database. Using the closed itemset lattice framework, we show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of finding frequent closed itemsets. Based on this statement, we can construct efficient data mining algorithms by limiting the search space to the closed itemset lattice rather than the subset lattice. Moreover, we show that the set of all frequent closed itemsets suffices to determined a reduced set of association rules, thus addressing another important data mining algorithm: limiting the number of rules produced without information loss. We propose a new algorithm, called A-Close, using a closure mechanism to find frequent closed itemsets. We realized experiments to compared our approach to commonly used frequent itemset search approach. Those experiments showed that our approach is very valuable for dense and/or correlated data that present an important part of existing database.},

abstract = {Stock forecasting involves complex interactions between market-influencing factors and unknown ran- dom processes. In this study, an integrated system, CBDWNN by combining dynamic time windows, case based reasoning (CBR), and neural network for stock trading prediction is developed and it includes three different stages: (1) screening out potential stocks and the important influential factors; (2) using back propagation network (BPN) to predict the buy/sell points (wave peak and wave trough) of stock price and (3) adopting case based dynamic window (CBDW) to further improve the forecasting results from BPN. The system developed in this research is a first attempt in the literature to predict the sell/buy deci- sion points instead of stock price itself. The empirical results show that the CBDW can assist the BPN to reduce the false alarm of buying or selling decisions. Nine different stocks with different trends, i.e., upward, downward and steady, are studied and one individual stock (AUO) will be studied as case exam- ple. The rates of return for upward, steady, and downward trend stocks are higher than 93.57{\%}, 37.75{\%}, and 46.62{\%}, respectively. These results are all very promising and better than using CBR or BPN alone.},

@article{Jain2010a,
abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.},

abstract = { Data mining is defined as the process of discovering significant and potentially useful patterns in large volumes of data. Discovering associations between items in a large database is one such data mining activity. In finding associations, support is used as an indicator as to whether an association is interesting. In this paper, we discuss three alternative interest measures for associations: any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond. We prove that the important downward closure property applies to both all-confidence and bond. We show that downward closure does not hold for any-confidence. We also prove that, if associations have a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond, then those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum support and the rules produced from those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum confidence as well. However, associations that have that minimum support (and likewise their rules that have minimum confidence) may not satisfy the minimum all-confidence or minimum bond constraint. We describe the algorithms that efficiently find all associations with a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond and present some experimental results.},

One, of the most important aspects of genomic research is the understanding of the entire gene repertoire, thus eventually allowing a full understanding of gene functions. This article provides some examples of comparative genomic analyses of polypeptide ligands and their receptors. The Chinese name for the emerging field of "evolutionary genomics" is proposed here in order to emphasize the non-progressive nature of the evolutionary process and the global analyses of the complete gene sets in diverse organisms.},

The advent of modern data mining tools and sophisticated database technologies has enabled researchers to handle the huge amount of data generated by the dynamic stock market with ease. In this paper, the predictability of stock index movement of the popular Indian Stock Market indices BSE-SENSEX and NSE-NIFTY are investigated with the data mining tool of k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (k-NN) by forecasting the daily movement of the indices. To evaluate the efficiency of the classification technique, the performance of k-NN algorithm is compared with that of the Logistic Regression model. The analysis is applied to the BSE-SENSEX and NSE-NIFTY for the period from January 2006 to May 2011.},

The short and long term prediction performance of these models are evaluated with test data and the results obtained are compared with those obtained from the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based models. It is in general observed that the new models are computationally more efficient, prediction wise more accurate and show faster convergence compared to other evolutionary computing models such as GA and PSO based models. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In other words, the goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms of predictor features. The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various supervised machine learning classification techniques. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all supervised machine learning classification algorithms (also known induction classification algorithms), yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.},

Three different wavelet algorithms are simulated and applied on nine classes of power signal time series, which primarily belongs to an important problem area called electric power quality. In contrast to the wavelet analysis, the paper presents a new approach called S-transform-based time frequency analysis in processing power quality disturbance data. Certain pertinent feature vectors are extracted using the well-known wavelet methods and the new approach using S-transform. Neural networks are then used to compute the classification accuracy of the feature vectors. Certain characteristics of the wavelet feature vectors are apparent from the results. Further in large data sets partitioning is done and similarities of pattern vectors present in different sections are determined. The approach is a general one and can be applied to pattern classification, similarity determination, and knowledge discovery in time varying data patterns occurring in many practical sciences and engineering problems.},

Compared to the previous algorithms, our algorithm reduces both CPU and I/O overheads. In our experimental study it was found that for large databases, the CPU overhead was reduced by as much as a factor of seven and I/O was reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Hence this algorithm is especially suitable for very large size databases. The algorithm is also ideally suited for parallelization. We have performed extensive experiments and compared the performance of the algorithm with one of the best existing algorithms.},

Some studies take these results as an indication of decaying of conditional contributors while others argue that this is not the case and depends on other factors (e.g. boredom) which may affect players' contribution. This study tries to find a measure to quantify the magnitude of this change in behaviour which may lead to better understanding of these situations. To obtain time sensitive clusters new attributes have been created which depend on existing tributes of the players namely their initial stated willingness for contribution, their actual contribution and belief of other players' contribution. Then external cluster validity and area under the curve of roc analysis are used to quantify differences between each two consecutive game plays. Results indicate that there is no significant change in players' behaviour while progressing in the game periods.},

The focus of this chapter is overwhelmingly on the third heading, that of tools. These in turn divide, roughly, into tools for analyzing data, tools for constructing and evaluating models, and tools for measuring complexity. I discuss the principles of statistical learning and model selection; time series analysis; cellular automata; agent-based models; the evaluation of complex-systems models; infor-mation theory; and ways of measuring complexity. Throughout, I give only rough outlines of techniques, so that readers, confronted with new problems, will have a sense of which ones might be suitable, and which ones definitely are not.},

@article{Yin2003,
abstract = {Recent studies in data mining have proposed a new classification approach, called associative classification, which, according to several reports, such as [7, 6], achieves higher classification accuracy than traditional classification approaches such as C4.5. However, the approach also suffers from two major deficiencies: (1) it generates a very large number of association rules, which leads to high processing overhead; and (2) its confidence-based rule evaluation measure may lead to overfitting. In comparison with associative classification, tra- ditional rule-based classifiers, such as C4.5, FOIL and RIPPER, are substantially faster but their accuracy, in most cases, may not be as high. In this paper, we propose a new classification approach, CPAR (Classi- fication based on Predictive Association Rules), which combines the advantages of both associative classifica- tion and traditional rule-based classification. Instead of generating a large number of candidate rules as in asso- ciative classification, CPAR adopts a greedy algorithm to generate rules directly from training data. Moreover, CPAR generates and tests more rules than traditional rule-based classifiers to avoid missing important rules. To avoid overfitting, CPAR uses expected accuracy to evaluate each rule and uses the best k rules in predic- tion.},

abstract = {This paper presents a rule-based approach for the classification of power quality disturbances. The disturbed signal is first characterized using the multi-resolution S-transform, which acts as a feature extraction tool. Then, a simple but robust rule-based classification algorithm is used to identify disturbances. This algorithm uses linear and parabolic rules as pattern classifiers where decision boundaries are established by a heuristic search. The classification algorithm has a modular structure where each module works separately to detect specific disturbances. The most common types of disturbances, including sags, interruptions, swells, harmonics and oscillatory transients, were analyzed. Moreover, complex disturbances consisting of combinations of two simple events (simultaneous or consecutive in the same interval) were also analyzed. In both cases, noise, ranging from 40 to 20 dB, was also considered. The tested data set contains power quality signals obtained using mathematical models, power quality events obtained from power network's simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC and measured signals at electrical installations. Finally, evaluation results verifying the accuracy of the proposed method are presented and compared to those obtained from a classification system based on an artificial neural network. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

Data mining is well founded on the theory that the historic data holds the essential memory for predicting the future direction. This technology is designed to help investors discover hidden patterns from the historic data that have probable predictive capability in their investment decisions. The prediction of stock markets is regarded as a challenging task of financial time series prediction. Data analysis is one way of predicting if future stocks prices will increase or decrease. Five methods of analyzing stocks were combined to predict if the day's closing price would increase or decrease. These methods were Typical Price (TP), Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), CMI and Moving Average (MA). This paper discussed various techniques which are able to predict with future closing stock price will increase or decrease better than level of significance. Also, it investigated various global events and their issues predicting on stock markets. It supports numerically and graphically.},

abstract = {The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm.We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation. Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.1 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Content Analysis and Indexing—Indexing methods; H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval—Information filtering; H.3.4 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Systems and Software—Performance evaluation (efficiency and effectiveness); I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning— Induction},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal clustering is a process of grouping objects based on their spatial and temporal similarity. It is relatively new subfield of data mining which gained high popularity especially in geographic information sciences due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or environmental devices that record position, time or/and environmental properties of an object or set of objects in real-time. As a consequence, different types and large amounts of spatio-temporal data became available that introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel approaches to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we concentrate on the spatio-temporal clustering in geographic space. First, we provide a classification of different types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on one type of spatio-temporal clustering - trajectory clustering, provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and methods of spatio-temporal clustering and finally present several scenarios in different application domains such as movement, cellular networks and environmental studies.},

abstract = {Similarity search and detection is a central problem in time series data processing and management. Most approaches to this problem have been developed around the notion of dynamic time warping, whereas several dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed to improve the efficiency of similarity searches. Due to the continuous increasing of sources of time series data and the cruciality of real-world applications that use such data, we believe there is a challenging demand for supporting similarity detection in time series in a both accurate and fast way. Our proposal is to define a concise yet feature-rich representation of time series, on which the dynamic time warping can be applied for effective and efficient similarity detection of time series. We present the Derivative time series Segment Approximation (DSA) representation model, which originally features derivative estimation, segmentation and segment approximation to provide both high sensitivity in capturing the main trends of time series and data compression. We extensively compare DSA with state-of-the-art similarity methods and dimensionality reduction techniques in clustering and classification frameworks. Experimental evidence from effectiveness and efficiency tests on various datasets shows that DSA is well-suited to support both accurate and fast similarity detection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A major challenge in frequent-pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results. To compress the frequent patterns, we propose to cluster frequent patterns with a tightness measure ?? (called ??-cluster), and select a representative pattern for each cluster. The problem of finding a minimum set of representative patterns is shown NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods, RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to RPglobal, and both can reduce the number of closed frequent patterns by almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, RPlocal mines even faster than FPClose [G. Grahne, J. Zhu, Efficiently using prefix-trees in mining frequent itemsets, in: Proc. IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations (FIMI'03)], a very fast closed frequent-pattern mining method. We also show that RPglobal and RPlocal can be combined together to balance the quality and efficiency. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Association rule discovery has emerged as an important problem in knowledge discovery and data mining. The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets, which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The related database items are grouped together into clusters representing the potential maximal frequent itemsets in the database. Each cluster induces a sub-lattice of the itemset lattice. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented, which quickly identify all the true maximal frequent itemsets, and all their subsets if desired. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed clustering and traversal techniques. The proposed algorithms scan a (pre-processed) database only once, addressing the open question in association mining, whether all the rules can be efficiently extracted in a single database pass. We experimentally compare the new algorithms against the previous approaches, obtaining improvements of more than an order of magnitude for our test databases.},

Researchers have argued that DP provides the appropriate basis for compiling planning results into reactive strategies for real-time control, as well as for learning such strategies when the system being controlled is incompletely known. We introduce an algorithm based on DP, which we call Real-Time DP (RTDP), by which an embedded system can improve its performance with experience. RTDP generalizes Korf's Learning-Real-Time-A algorithm to problems involving uncertainty. We invoke results from the theory of asynchronous DP to prove that RTDP achieves optimal behavior in several different classes of problems. We also use the theory of asynchronous DP to illuminate aspects of other DP-based reinforcement learning methods such as Watkins' Q-Learning algorithm. A secondary aim of this article is to provide a bridge between AI research on real-time planning and learning and relevant concepts and algorithms from control theory.},

Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier's evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem.

abstract = {Most of the work in machine learning assume that examples are generated at random according to some stationary probability distribution. In this work we study the problem of learning when the class-probability distribution that generate the examples changes over time. We present a method for detection of changes in the probability distribution of examples. A central idea is the concept of context: a set of contiguous examples where the distribution is stationary. The idea behind the drift detection method is to control the online error-rate of the algorithm. The training examples are presented in sequence. When a new training example is available, it is classi ed using the actual model. Statistical theory guarantees that while the distribution is stationary, the error wil decrease. When the distribution changes, the error will increase. The method controls the trace of the online error of the algorithm. For the actual context we de ne a warning level, and a drift level. A new context is declared, if in a sequence of examples, the error increases reaching the warning level at example kw, and the drift level at example kd. This is an indication of a change in the distribution of the examples. The algorithm learns a new model using only the examples since kw. The method was tested with a set of eight arti cial datasets and a real world dataset. We used three learning algorithms: a perceptron, a neural network and a decision tree. The experimental results show a good performance detecting drift and also with learning the new concept. We also observe that the method is independent of the learning algorithm.},

The . All - text and , letting . Abstract—Recent remote sensing literature has shown that sup - port vector machine (SVM) methods generally outperform tra - ditional statistical and neural methods in classification problems involving hyperspectral images . However , there are still open is - sues that , if suitably addressed , could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy . Two especially critical issues are : 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection . In this paper , these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery . This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i . e . , regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way . For these purposes , it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers . In particular , two criteria are explored , namely : 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound .

abstract = {We introduce an ensemble of classifiers-based approach for incremental learning of concept drift, characterized by nonstationary environments (NSEs), where the underlying data distributions change over time. The proposed algorithm, named Learn++.NSE, learns from consecutive batches of data without making any assumptions on the nature or rate of drift; it can learn from such environments that experience constant or variable rate of drift, addition or deletion of concept classes, as well as cyclical drift. The algorithm learns incrementally, as other members of the Learn++ family of algorithms, that is, without requiring access to previously seen data. Learn++.NSE trains one new classifier for each batch of data it receives, and combines these classifiers using a dynamically weighted majority voting. The novelty of the approach is in determining the voting weights, based on each classifier's time-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. This approach allows the algorithm to recognize, and act accordingly, to the changes in underlying data distributions, as well as to a possible reoccurrence of an earlier distribution. We evaluate the algorithm on several synthetic datasets designed to simulate a variety of nonstationary environments, as well as a real-world weather prediction dataset. Comparisons with several other approaches are also included. Results indicate that Learn++.NSE can track the changing environments very closely, regardless of the type of concept drift. To allow future use, comparison and benchmarking by interested researchers, we also release our data used in this paper},

The performance of the voting by multiple fuzzy if-then rules is examined by computer simulations on the iris data. Next, we discuss the voting by multiple fuzzy rule-based classification systems. Three voting methods (i.e., a perfect unison rule, a majority rule, and a weighted voting rule) are used for combining classification results by multiple fuzzy rule-based classification systems. Finally, we compare the performance of fuzzy rule-based classification systems with that of other classification methods such as neural networks and statistical techniques by computer simulations on some well-known test problems.},

@article{Thissen2003,
abstract = {Time series prediction can be a very useful tool in the field of process chemometrics to forecast and to study the behaviour of key process parameters in time. This creates the possibility to give early warnings of possible process malfunctioning. In this paper, time series prediction is performed by support vector machines (SVMs), Elman recurrent neural networks, and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. A comparison of these three methods is made based on their predicting ability. In the field of chemometrics, SVMs are hardly used even though they have many theoretical advantages for both classification and regression tasks. These advantages stem from the specific formulation of a (convex) objective function with constraints which is solved using Lagrange Multipliers and has the characteristics that: (1) a global optimal solution exists which will be found, (2) the result is a general solution avoiding overtraining, (3) the solution is sparse and only a limited set of training points contribute to this solution, and (4) nonlinear solutions can be calculated efficiently due to the usage of inner products. The method comparison is performed on two simulated data sets and one real-world industrial data set. The simulated data sets are a data set generated according to the ARMA principles and the Mackey-Glass data set, often used for benchmarking. The first data set is relatively easy whereas the second data set is a more difficult nonlinear chaotic data set. The real-world data set stems from a filtration unit in a yarn spinning process and it contains differential pressure values. These values are a measure of the contamination level of a filter. For practical purposes, it is very important to predict these values accurately because they play a crucial role in maintaining the quality of the process considered. As it is expected, it appears that the ARMA model performs best for the ARMA data set while the SVM and the Elman networks perform similarly. For the more difficult benchmark data set the SVM outperforms the ARMA model and in most of the cases outperforms the best of several Elman neural networks. For the real-world set, the SVM was trained using a training set containing only one tenth of the points of the original training set which was used for the other methods. This was done to test its performance if only few data would be available. Using the same test set for all methods, it appeared that prediction results were equally well for both the SVM and the ARMA model whereas the Elman network could not be used to predict these series. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission of dengue viruses (DENV), the leading cause of arboviral disease worldwide, is known to vary through time and space, likely owing to a combination of factors related to the human host, virus, mosquito vector, and environment. An improved understanding of variation in transmission patterns is fundamental to conducting surveillance and implementing disease prevention strategies. To test the hypothesis that DENV transmission is spatially and temporally focal, we compared geographic and temporal characteristics within Thai villages where DENV are and are not being actively transmitted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Cluster investigations were conducted within 100 m of homes where febrile index children with (positive clusters) and without (negative clusters) acute dengue lived during two seasons of peak DENV transmission. Data on human infection and mosquito infection/density were examined to precisely (1) define the spatial and temporal dimensions of DENV transmission, (2) correlate these factors with variation in DENV transmission, and (3) determine the burden of inapparent and symptomatic infections. Among 556 village children enrolled as neighbors of 12 dengue-positive and 22 dengue-negative index cases, all 27 DENV infections (4.9{\%} of enrollees) occurred in positive clusters (p {\textless} 0.01; attributable risk [AR] = 10.4 per 100; 95{\%} confidence interval 1-19.8 per 100]. In positive clusters, 12.4{\%} of enrollees became infected in a 15-d period and DENV infections were aggregated centrally near homes of index cases. As only 1 of 217 pairs of serologic specimens tested in positive clusters revealed a recent DENV infection that occurred prior to cluster initiation, we attribute the observed DENV transmission subsequent to cluster investigation to recent DENV transmission activity. Of the 1,022 female adult Ae. aegypti collected, all eight (0.8{\%}) dengue-infected mosquitoes came from houses in positive clusters; none from control clusters or schools. Distinguishing features between positive and negative clusters were greater availability of piped water in negative clusters (p {\textless} 0.01) and greater number of Ae. aegypti pupae per person in positive clusters (p = 0.04). During primarily DENV-4 transmission seasons, the ratio of inapparent to symptomatic infections was nearly 1:1 among child enrollees. Study limitations included inability to sample all children and mosquitoes within each cluster and our reliance on serologic rather than virologic evidence of interval infections in enrollees given restrictions on the frequency of blood collections in children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal the remarkably focal nature of DENV transmission within a hyperendemic rural area of Thailand. These data suggest that active school-based dengue case detection prompting local spraying could contain recent virus introductions and reduce the longitudinal risk of virus spread within rural areas. Our results should prompt future cluster studies to explore how host immune and behavioral aspects may impact DENV transmission and prevention strategies. Cluster methodology could serve as a useful research tool for investigation of other temporally and spatially clustered infectious diseases.},

abstract = {Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (DMan), Euclidean (DE) and Mahalanobis (DMah) distance measures, to correlation (DCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; DPCA) and Fourier based (DFFT,D$\xi$,DFk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) DMan, DE, DPCA, DFk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) DMah accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) DCC measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based DFFT and D$\xi$ show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this article, we propose some methods for deriving symbolic interpretation of data in the form of rule based learning systems by using Support Vector Machines (SVM). First, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) learning techniques are explored, as is usual in the literature, since the local nature of this paradigm makes it a suitable plat-form for performing rule extraction. By using support vectors from a learned SVM it is possible in our approach to use any standard Radial Basis Function (RBF) learning tech-nique for the rule extraction, whilst avoiding the overlapping between classes problem. We will show that merging node centers and support vectors explanation rules can be obtained in the form of ellipsoids and hyper-rectangles. Next, in a dual form, following the frame-work developed for RBFNN, we construct an algorithm for SVM. Taking SVM as the main paradigm, geometry in the input space is defined from a combination of support vectors and prototype vectors obtained from any clustering algorithm. Finally, randomness associ-ated with clustering algorithms or RBF learning is avoided by using only a learned SVM to define the geometry of the studied region. The results obtained from a certain number of experiments on benchmarks in different domains are also given, leading to a conclusion on the viability of our proposal.},

abstract = {Multiple classifier combination is a technique that combines the decisions of different classifiers. Combination can reduce the variance of estimation errors and improve the overall classification accuracy. However, direct application of combination schemes developed for pattern recognition to solving business problems has some limitations, because business problems cannot be explained completely by the results provided by machine-learning-driven classifiers alone owing to their intrinsic complexity. To solve such problems, this paper proposes an approach that is capable of incorporating the subjective problem-solving knowledge of humans into the results of quantitative models. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to combine classifiers stemming from machine learning, experts, and users. We use our GA-based method to predict the Korea stock price index (KOSPI).},

Given a (sub)sequence S, a query sequence Q, lower and upper bounds on shifting and scaling parameters, and a tolerance ??, 5 is considered boundedly similar to Q if S can be shifted and scaled within the specified bounds to produce a modified sequence S' whose distance from Q is within ??. We use similarity transformation to formalize the notion of bounded similarity. We then describe a framework that supports the resulting set of queries; it is based on {\&} fingerprint method that normalizes the data and saves the normalization parameters.

abstract = {Time series (particularly multivariate) classification has drawn a lot of attention in the literature because of its broad applications for different domains, such as health informatics and bioinformatics. Thus, many algorithms have been developed for this task. Among them, nearest neighbor classification (particularly 1-NN) combined with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) achieves the state of the art performance. However, when data set grows larger, the time consumption of 1-NN with DTW grows linearly. Compared to 1-NN with DTW, the traditional feature-based classification methods are usually more efficient but less effective since their performance is usually dependent on the quality of hand-crafted features. To that end, in this paper, we explore the feature learning techniques to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for multivariate time series classification. We conduct two groups of experiments on real-world data sets from different application domains. The final results show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art but also competitive in accuracy. It also demonstrates that feature learning is worth to investigate for time series classification.},

abstract = {—To design a fuzzy rule-based classification system (fuzzy classifier) with good generalization ability in a high di-mensional feature space has been an active research topic for a long time. As a powerful machine learning approach for pattern recognition problems, support vector machine (SVM) is known to have good generalization ability. More importantly, an SVM can work very well on a high-(or even infinite) dimensional feature space. This paper investigates the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines, establishes a link between fuzzy rules and kernels, and proposes a learning algorithm for fuzzy classifiers. We first show that a fuzzy classifier implicitly defines a translation invariant kernel under the assumption that all membership functions associated with the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. Fuzzy inference on the IF-part of a fuzzy rule can be viewed as evaluating the kernel function. The kernel function is then proven to be a Mercer kernel if the reference functions meet certain spectral requirement. The corresponding fuzzy classifier is named positive definite fuzzy classifier (PDFC). A PDFC can be built from the given training samples based on a support vector learning approach with the IF-part fuzzy rules given by the support vectors. Since the learning process minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk (expected prediction error) instead of the empirical risk (training error), the resulting PDFC usually has good generalization. Moreover, because of the sparsity properties of the SVMs, the number of fuzzy rules is irrelevant to the dimension of input space. In this sense, we avoid the " curse of dimensionality. " Finally, PDFCs with different reference functions are constructed using the support vector learning approach. The performance of the PDFCs is illustrated by extensive experimental results. Comparisons with other methods are also provided.},

abstract = {While most time series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function, in this work we motivate the need for an index structure that can support multiple distance measures. Our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of similar trajectories. Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, and video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) model that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real-world applications. However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance and the increasingly popular dynamic time warping (DTW). While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures, a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index. Our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision/recall. The experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the LCSS and the DTW.},

An alternative approach is to classify traffic by exploiting the distinctive characteristics of applications when they communicate on a network. We pursue this latter approach and demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify groups of traffic that are similar using only transport layer statistics. Our work considers two unsupervised clustering algorithms, namely K-Means and DBSCAN, that have previously not been used for network traffic classification. We evaluate these two algorithms and compare them to the previously used AutoClass algorithm, using empirical Internet traces. The experimental results show that both K-Means and DBSCAN work very well and much more quickly then AutoClass. Our results indicate that although DBSCAN has lower accuracy compared to K-Means and AutoClass, DBSCAN produces better clusters},

abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW), which finds the minimum path by providing non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a distance measure for time series classification and clustering. However, DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition. Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW), which is a penalty-based DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A new weight function, called the modified logistic weight function (MLWF), is also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classification and clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classification and clustering problems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Baena-Garcia2006,
abstract = {An emerging problem in Data Streams is the detection of concept drift. This problem is aggravated when the drift is gradual over time. In this work we define a method for detecting concept drift, even in the case of slow gradual change. It is based on the estimated distribution of the distances between classification errors. The proposed method can be used with any learning algorithm in two ways: using it as a wrapper of a batch learning algorithm or implementing it inside an incremental and online algorithm. The experimentation results compare our method (EDDM) with a similar one (DDM). Latter uses the error-rate instead of distance-error-rate},

@article{Kroha2004,
abstract = {In this report we investigate how much similarity good news and bad news may have in context of long-terms market trends. We discuss the relation between text mining, classification, and information retrieval. We present examples that use identical set of words but have a quite different meaning, we present examples that can be interpreted in both positive or negative sense so that the decision is difficult as before reading them. Our examples prove that methods of information retrieval are not strong enough to solve problems as specified above. For searching of common properties in groups of news we had used classifiers (e.g. naive Bayes classifier) after we found that the use of diagnostic methods did not deliver reasonable results. For our experiments we have used historical data concerning the German market index DAX30},
